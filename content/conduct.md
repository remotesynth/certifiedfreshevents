All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our virtual meetups, live events or other organized activity, whether online or in-person, are required to agree with the following code of conduct. The organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### The Quick Version

Our meetups and events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate, including during talks, workshops, parties, Discord and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup or event _without a refund_ at the discretion of the organizers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) at in-person events should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion with no refund. Violators further risk being banned from attending future events, either online or in-person.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us immediately via our [contact form](/contact/), [email](mailto:brian@cfe.dev) or staff, if this is an in-person event.

For in-person events, staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
