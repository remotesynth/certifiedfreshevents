GraphQL can offer a number of benefits over traditional REST, allowing for complex queries that can get only the data you need but also all the data you need. This means you save important bytes by not passing too much data to the client while also getting everything you need in a single query response rather than multiple consecutive API requests. What if you have an existing REST API but want to take advantage of GraphQL? In this session, Alex Patterson will show how you can wrap existing REST APIs in GraphQL to give you the benefits of GraphQL without requiring a major rewrite of existing REST APIs.
