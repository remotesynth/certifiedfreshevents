The way people interact with devices and the internet is changing quickly. We're no longer just clicking on a desktop browser or tapping on a phone screen. We're chatting with bots using text or voice. Or we're interacting with all sorts of internet connected devices that, in many cases don't even have a screen. In this free online meetup, Tomomi Imura of Slack and David Simmons of InfluxData will discuss some these important topics around chat bots, IoT and artificial intelligence.
