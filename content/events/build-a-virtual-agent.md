Text and chat have become a very common means of interacting with companies, often via smart chat bots that can handle an array of customer service interactions. Underlying this, though, are a ton of complex technologies. In this free, virtual meetup, Dave Nugent of IBM  will explore how to build one of these using JavaScript, Twilio and IBM's Watson services for natural language processing.
