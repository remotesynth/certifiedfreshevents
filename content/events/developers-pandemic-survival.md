The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically changed the way everyone works - developers included. Even those who are fortunate enough to have kept their jobs find many additional complications to deal with. Folks who were used to going into the office every day suddenly find themselves working from home, which isn't always as easy as it sounds. We are all also dealing with additional stress that can lead to burnout.

In this special event, we'll have two sessions to help developers cope with the pandemic. Dawn Parzych will offer tips and strategies for coping with working from home and Peter McKee will talk about dealing with stress and burnout.
