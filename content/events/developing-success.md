Knowing how to code is only one piece of being a successful developer. The other parts involve a desire to learn, an ability to communicate and work with those around you, and even, sometimes, the willingness to accept and learn from failure.

In this free event, Alyssa Nicoll of Progress and Jenell Pizarro of Skillcrush will explore how to develop some of these developer skillsets beyond coding and offer advice that will help you succeed in your career.
