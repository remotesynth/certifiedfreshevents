Search on any site can be a complicated problem to solve. When it comes to static sites, however, the problem can be a lot more complicated since you want to limit how much JavaScript you send to the client and you need the search to be fast. Existing solutions were all problematic in this area. In this session, Liam Bigelow will introduce us to Pagefind, a new library that aims to make search for static sites both lightweight and performant.
