Technology is moving quickly - things like bots, serverless, VR/AR, IoT and more are quickly changing both how we develop and what we develop for. And we thought things got complex when we were just targeting desktop and mobile devices! In this free, online event we'll cover two of those trends that are shaping how we develop and what we develop for.

As we discussed [in October](https://certifiedfreshevents.com/events/going-serverless/), the trend towards serverless architectures is changing the way developers build their apps. It solves a number of problems but also brings new complexities. Brian LeRoux will discuss how one tool is aiming to address the complexities it can bring.

Complex, conversational bots are also changing the ways in which businesses interact with their customers. Many common tasks once handled via the phone or chat with a live person can now be handled by an automated bot. Andy Barnov will teach you how you can build a conversational bot using Ruby.
