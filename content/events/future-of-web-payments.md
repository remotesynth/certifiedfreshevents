Building a checkout process is almost a right of passage for a web developer, but, unfortunately, it has often been difficult and complicated to do. Part of the problem was that, even though this was a common requirement, there was no standard way to implement payments on the web. The good news is, that is changing. In this session, Robert Wozniak, Invited Expert at the W3C, will discuss new APIs that will help standardize the way we handle payments in the browser.
