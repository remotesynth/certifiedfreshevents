Serverless and Jamstack are like peanut butter and jelly. Each is great on its own, but together they are incredible. It's become nearly unthinkable to build a Jamstack site today without needing to leverage serverless in some manner. In this hands-on, guided workshop, Tamas Piros will walk you through everything you need to know to get the full power of serverless in your Jamstack applications.
