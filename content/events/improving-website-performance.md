The success or failure of a web application is heavily impacted by its performance. As [MDN notes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Performance/why_web_performance), "site speed directly affects bounce rates, conversion rates, revenue, user satisfaction, and search engine ranking.  Performant sites have been shown to increase visitor retention and user satisfaction." In this free session, Henri Helvetica will explore the rules we've lived by for the last decade when it comes to web performance and how these rules apply on today's web.
