Vue is one of the hottest front-end frameworks right now. It is the top trending project overall in the yearly [JavaScipt Rising Stars](https://risingstars.js.org/2018/en/#section-all) and earlier this year became the [second most starred project on GitHub](https://twitter.com/vuejs/status/1108985101436637185). It's definitely something every front-end or JavaScript developer should be familiar with. Thankfully, Raymond Camden will give us the rundown on how to get started using it.
