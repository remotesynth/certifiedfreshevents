For many developers, hardware can be intimidating. This is why the Internet of Things can seem simultaneously appealing and scary. There are so many promising ideas on how to mix code and devices, but how do all the wires and devices connect? Is there soldering involved?

In this event, Brandon Satrom and Brad Marsh will show simple and practical ways for getting started in IoT - from basic electronics to smart home integration. They’ll show how IoT can be so accessible and fun that you’ll even want to get the kids involved!
