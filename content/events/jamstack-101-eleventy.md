Eleventy (or 11ty for short) is a different kind of JavaScript-based static site generator in that it is designed to be simple and easy-to-user without relying on any JavaScript framework. This can make it ideal for developers who want to get started building Jamstack sites but without the learning curve of React, Vue or Angular. In this free virtual meetup, Joel Varty will show you how to get started building Jamstack sites using JavaScript and Eleventy.
