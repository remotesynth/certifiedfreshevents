Gatsby is the most popular tool for creating Jamstack sites today. It's popularity is driven in part because it uses React and in part because it has a thriving ecosystem of plugins and learning resources. In this free virtual meetup, Joel Varty will guide you in getting started with Gatsby to create a site using a headless CMS and deploying to Netlify.
