JAMstack is a web application architecture that has been gaining traction lately. It combines the use of static site generators, JavaScript and APIs and services to create a decoupled site architecture that can improve performance and security. In this free, virtual meetup, Gift Egwuenu will walk through the benefits of JAMstack and show how to create JAMstack sites using Gridsome.
