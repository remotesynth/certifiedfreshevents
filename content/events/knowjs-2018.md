KnowJS is a **full-day** of learning and training focused on JavaScript language fundamentals.

### What makes KnowJS different?

* **It is hands-on training and not a conference.** 100% online and interactive with live chat and Q&A. You also get full access to recordings to return and learn on your own schedule. We'll feature four introductory sessions (available for free) and four hands-on sessions.
* **It is not for beginners - it is for JavaScript developers who aspire to be experts or who want to reinforce their skills.** We’ll cover the topics you won’t typically see in a standard JavaScript training.
* **It features 4 of the top trainers and JavaScript experts in the industry.** Our teachers created some of the most well-known and highly regarded material for JavaScript developers including books, video training courses, open source projects and more!
* **We aren’t teaching framework X or toolchain Y, we’re focused on skills and knowledge around JavaScript language fundamentals.** These skills are transferrable to any framework (or none) or toolchain.
