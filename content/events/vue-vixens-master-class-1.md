In partnership with [Vue Vixens](https://vuevixens.org/), we're offering a special event featuring two speakers from their organization covering two separate but equally important and interesting topics. [NOTE: The initial topic has been removed.] Natalia Tepluhina will teach us about GraphQL for querying your API and Apollo, which can help convert an existing REST API into a GraphQL schema.
