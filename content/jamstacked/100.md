Milestones can feel arbitrary, but saying something is arbitrary doesn't make it not simultaneously meaningful. 100 issues and 4 years of this newsletter is definitely meaningful to me. I will admit that, at times over those 4 yers when I am feeling stressed and overburdened, I'd thought of walking away from this task as it consumes a lot of effort and time. But I enjoy the opportunity to learn from all the people whose articles are featured and the opportunity to connect with you all to share some of my excitement about building for the web. I hope this newsletter has and continues to be useful to you.

## What's Good

[The State of Jamstack: Developers Want Return to Simplicity](https://thenewstack.io/the-state-of-jamstack-developers-want-return-to-simplicity/)<br>
The conversations started by Mike Neumegen on [The Future of Jamstack](http://thefutureofjamstack.org/) have generated a lot of discussion. In this post, a variety of developers reflect on how the Jamstack became muddled and complex. A follow up discussion led to calls for [an ‘anti-capitalistic Jamstack’](https://thenewstack.io/developer-panel-wants-an-anti-capitalistic-jamstack/). What does this mean? As Cassidy Williams stated, "I think we pulled in a whole lot of things [into the Jamstack definition]...for the shareholders". Salma Alam Naylor, also a panel participant and former Netlify employee, [recounted her experiences](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/the-future-of-jamstack-is-anti-capitalist/) as well.<br>

[Is Hosting on Netlify Going to Bankrupt you?](https://wheresbaldo.dev/tech/netlify/is-hosting-on-netlify-going-to-bankrupt-you)<br>
While this was a hot topic this week, I debated whether or not to cover this, not out of favoritism, but because a proper discussion of this issue takes a lot more nuance than this format allows. That nuance is arguably missing from this post but it does cover the details of a controversy that involved a Netlify customer being sent a six-figure bill caused by overages potentially triggered by a DDoS attack. Netlify ultimately waived the bill, admitting that it wasn't handled well and that they are examining their practices. Matt Biilmann [posted his response here](https://twitter.com/biilmann/status/1762924788350136475). Theo, who admits his bias towards Vercel, does [cover a lot of the complexities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi9IDtgS6hc) involved and how many providers have made (and learn) from similar mistakes.<br>
