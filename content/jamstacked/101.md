Fred K. Schott announced the Astro Technology Company, along with a $7m round of seed funding, a little more than a year ago. Astro had made great strides in the framework and in adoption during that year, but, beyond sponsorship, there were no outward signs of a monetization strategy until last week when they announced their first paid service, Astro DB.

So far, it's a different approach than Gatsby took many years ago with Gatsby Cloud, a product that ultimately put them in direct competition with platform companies like Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare and others (a strategy [Juan Diego Rodríguez claims](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/03/end-of-gatsby-journey/) doomed it). Instead, [Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/), Astro's first commercial service, can still be used on any of these providers. It'll be worth watching to see if this strategy continues as they expand their offerings.

## What's Good

**Astro, Astro and more Astro**<br>
This was quite a week for Astro and there's a lot to cover. The most surprising announcement was [Astro DB](https://astro.build/db/), a fully managed SQL database built on libSQL that is designed exclusively for Astro sites to make it easy to enable and configure. If you want to dig deeper, [Tyler at UI.dev](https://bytes.dev/archives/271?ck_subscriber_id=1697818004) covers this more in detail or the Astro team wrote more about [how and why they built it](https://astro.build/blog/astro-db-deep-dive/). Also Art Rosnovsky [wrote up a tutorial](https://rosnovsky.us/blog/exploring-astro-db) on his initial explorations of it.

This week also brought the release of [Astro 4.5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-450/), including a new Dev Audit UI that helps you uncover audit performance and accessibility issues, and the [Astro Developer Portal](https://astro.build/blog/dev-portal/) where theme authors can submit, manage, and promote their themes built for Astro. It's no surprise the New Stack's Richard MacManus recently labeled them a [Next.js Rival](https://thenewstack.io/astros-journey-from-static-site-generator-to-next-js-rival/).
