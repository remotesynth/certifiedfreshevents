title: "Buzzword Bingo for Front-end Devs"

---

This week I am working on a presentation that I am giving later this month on explaining front-end buzzwords. It started out trying to lay out the differences between Jamstack and composable but then quickly had to dive into a laundry list of other buzzwords used to explain these: headless, pre-rendering, SSG/SSR/CSR/ISR, edge, middleware, islands, etc.

Suffice it to say, we love our jargon and we also love to hate on our jargon (or another favorite pastime, declaring [buzzword] dead). I'm definitely not criticizing the use of buzzwords/jargon – they can be useful shorthands – but it is interesting realizing how completely inundated with it we often are.

Netlify had a couple of significant announcements this week. The first is the release of their new Next runtime, which adds full support for the App Router as well as automatic fine-grained caching, on-demand and time-based revalidation and integration with Netlify's image optimization service.
