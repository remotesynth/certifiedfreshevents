You can be forgiven if you were unable to keep up with the long list of releases from Cloudflare's latest Developer Week. Cloudflare loves there various weeks, which usually bring a massive list of new products, new features and other announcements. I did my best to cover all the news you need to know as a web and full-stack developer.

[2024 Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)<br>
Notable highlights are Astro being positioned in their "trial" ring, which include newer tools and technologies ThoughtWorks thinks are ready for broad adoption. Edge functions was also ranked as trial. Web components for SSR and the Bun runtime both received an "assess" ranking, which is generally for more cutting edge tools and technologies that they think companies should look at but may be too soon for mass adoption.<br>
