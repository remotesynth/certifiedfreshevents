While frequently derided, buzzwords (aka jargon) actually play an important role in tech. For instance, you likely found this newsletter because of a buzzword (i.e. Jamstack) and understood the range of topics it would cover without my needing to go into detail. Still, we use a lot of jargon and often overlook the importance of explaining them. This isn't just important for new developers. I brought this up in a recent issue and decided to [write a blog post](https://remotesynthesis.com/blog/navigaitng-frontend-buzzwords/) where I do my best to explain a ton of them. Many of these are terms I commonly use here. I hope you all find it useful.

## What's Good

**The React 19 Beta Is Out**<br>
The release of the [React 19 Beta](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19) finally makes React Server Components (RSC) official. Despite the hype, you may be surprised to know that this was previously only available on the canary releases. However, the other big announcement was Actions, which are intended to remove the need to handle things like pending states, errors, optimistic updates, and sequential requests manually. As usual, Tyler from UI.dev has a [good summary](https://bytes.dev/archives/284?ck_subscriber_id=1697818004) as does [Kathryn Grayson Nanz](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/react-19-beta-released).
