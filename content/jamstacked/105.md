title: Making Web Sites Real Good with 11ty
issue: 105

---

Serverless and cloud computing play a huge role in modern full-stack web development. Things like lambdas and edge compute are what turn frameworks from just frontend JavaScript libraries into full-stack development frameworks. And, as AI is playing an increasing role in application development, serverless compute is how most applications will interact with generative AI. This is why I am super excited to be organizing next week's [Moar Serverless!! conference on May 23](https://moarserverless.com). I hope you'll join me there. It's completely free, so you can [grab your ticket today](https://www.crowdcast.io/c/moarserverless24)!

## What's Good

**The 11ty International Symposium on Making Web Sites Real Good**<br>
The first ever 11tyISMWSRG (for short ðŸ˜‰) was last week featuring 11 speakers (of course!), and not all of the talks were just about 11ty. If you missed it, you can catch the [full 6 hour stream recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLxJ6PtuF9M) on YouTube (really should have been 11 hours straight...missed opportunity). You can also catch [Zach's restrospective](https://www.zachleat.com/web/11ty-conf-retro/) on running the event. On The New Stack, Richard MacManus has a [great summary of the highlights](https://thenewstack.io/static-sites-do-scale-eleventy-vs-next-js-at-11ty-event/) including how 11ty represents a "act of rebellion against the dark forces driving todayâ€™s internet."
