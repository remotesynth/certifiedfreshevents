It's the summer (at least here in the Northern hemisphere), which often leads to slow(er) news days. That's ok after the madness that was May and it gives us the opportunity to catch our breath and explore some of the new releases from Astro, Docusaurus, UIX and TanStack Start or give htmx a shot. Read on for details.

## What's Good

[htmx: Simplicity in an Age of Complicated Solutions](https://www.erikheemskerk.nl/htmx-simplicity/)<br>
htmx is a library that let's you access to AJAX, CSS Transitions, WebSockets and Server Sent Events directly in HTML via attributes. Erik argues that this can offer a solution to some of the unnecessary complexity of JavaScript SPA frameworks for many use cases. He digs into detail about how it works and why he thinks it's worth exploring.<br>

The Astro team is sharing some of the features that they are working on for 2024 in a series of posts.

**New Frameworks**<br>
The New Stack wrote about two new frameworks. [UIX](https://thenewstack.io/uix-a-full-stack-web-dev-framework-leveraging-deno/) is a new full-stack framework built upon Deno for developing reactive web apps with restorable and shared state. Loraine spoke to the creators about the project. And TanStack has introduced a [new React meta-framework based on its router](https://thenewstack.io/tanstack-introduces-new-meta-framework-based-on-its-router/) called TanStack Start and Loraine talks to the TanStack creator about his plans for the project's upcoming release.<br>
