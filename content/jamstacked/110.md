title: Jamstacked Comes to an End

description: "Your Jamstack update"
---

This wasn't the intro I planned to write.

Last Sunday morning, I ended up in the hospital. I finally made it home Thursday afternoon. Don't worry – I'm recovering. But in that time I was gone, I had to cancel a virtual meetup and an interview show I co-host, postpone this newsletter and find coverage for the in-person meetup I run, to name just a few things. These are just things _outside_ my regular, full-time job.

This made me realize that perhaps it's time to reevaluate some of my extracurriculars. This newsletter started in March of 2020 and quickly grew to ultimately hitting around 3,500 active subscribers that year. Despite some efforts, it has pretty much been there since. That's not nothing, but it's also not what advertisers are looking for (they want 10k at a minimum). And the thing is, newsletters are a _ton_ of effort and relatively expensive to maintain.

The point is, Jamstacked isn't dying because it became irrelevant. We may not see the term Jamstack much anymore, but everything under the Jamstack umbrella is more popular than ever. I have loved gathering this info and sharing what I learn with you these past 4 years and I thank you for reading.

## What's Good

**Netlify Launch Week Announcements**<br>
Netlify's Launch Week started with announcing that [Netlify is (once again) Astro's official deployment partner](https://www.netlify.com/blog/netlify-astro-are-partnering/). The main takeaway here is that Netlify is funding Astro's development ($12.5k/mo) and seems to be betting on Astro as the framework of the future (or at least the one that can best compete with Next.js). To that end, they also pushed a [tutorial and example](https://developers.netlify.com/guides/how-astros-server-islands-deliver-progressive-rendering-for-your-sites/) of Astro's new server rendering (we'll talk about that more in a bit).

But they also introduced some other features including a new [Frameworks API](https://www.netlify.com/blog/introducing-the-netlify-frameworks-api/) intended to make integrations with Netlify easier for framework authors and a new
[Durable Caching Primitive](https://www.netlify.com/blog/announcing-durable-caching/) that makes on-demand incremental static regeneration (ISR) available for any framework.

In a word, no, but this is an interesting look at a decade of React – how it has changed, some of the critiques and defenses and some React alternatives that are gaining momentum.

[How to choose the best rendering strategy for your app](https://vercel.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-rendering-strategy-for-your-app)<br>
There are so many weird acronyms flying around rendering that it's easy to get confused. This guide, mostly centered in Next.js rendering options, is a really good breakdown of each type and what it is useful for.<br>

## Tools, Resources & More

The biggest announcement in [Astro 4.12](https://astro.build/blog/astro-4120/) is experimental support for server islands, which lets you generate most of your page statically and serve it from cache, while still server rendering components that contain personalized content.

[Hono v4.5.0](https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.5.0?ck_subscriber_id=1697818004) adds three new middlewares and support for React 19.

[Z.Js Framework](https://github.com/Z-Js-Framework/z-js#readme) is a new web application framework that aims to offer less mental overhead, particularly for simple apps.

You can now access the incoming requests IP Address and geolocation as well as system environment variables in [Vercel Functions](https://vercel.com/changelog/new-utilities-to-work-with-vercel-functions)

[NextRadar](https://nextradar.vercel.app/docs/latest) is a useful resource for keeping up with the latest news, tutorials and videos about Next.js.
