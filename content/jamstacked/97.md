Welcome to the first edition of Jamstacked hosted on [CFE.dev](https://cfe.dev). The content is the same but the from email and the format have changed. I am always happy to have feedback.

This edition is going out a couple days early because I'll be busy hosting the free [TheJam.dev](https://thejam.dev) virtual conference on Wednesday and Thursday. It's going to be a great event, so hopefully I'll see you there!

P.S. The change in publisher did essentially reset sponsorships for this newsletter. If your company would like to support Jamstacked, please reach out.

## What's Good

[Kind of annoyed at React](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/annoyed-at-react/)<br>
It is interesting (and, for me, somewhat validating) to hear someone as deeply experienced with React as Cassidy say, "React’s gotten really hard to understand." But Cassidy's issues go deeper than the complexity and include issues around transparency and communication – even as she states that she has no intention of abandoning React.<br>

## Tools, Resources & More

[Astro 4.2](https://astro.build/blog/astro-420/) adds experimental support for prerendering pages the user _on the client_ that the user is most likely to visit next using the Chromium-exclusive Speculation Rules API.

[Remix 2.5](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v250) added a SPA (single page application) mode (currently marked as unstable) rather than just the standard multi-page application (MPA) mode.

[Netlify's new developer hub](https://www.netlify.com/blog/hello-world-says-the-netlify-developer-hub/) hopes to make it easier for developer's to find the resources they need about using Netlify services.

[Waku v0.19](https://waku.gg/blog/introducing-create-pages) marks the frameworks transition from just a reference implementation for React Server Components (RSC) to a "Production-ready React framework."

Speaking of RSCs, Cloudflare is offering a [free React Server Component workshop](https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/react-server-components-workshop/) on January 30th. You do need a "work email" to register.

## Tidbits

[The Best Web Framework Doesn't Exist](https://dev.to/wasp/the-best-web-framework-doesnt-exist-2aom)<br>
