title: "Rediscovering the Simplicity of Early Jamstack"

There seems to be a growing desire to find ways to reduce the growing complexity of web development, but simplicity, it turns out, is a complex problem. What defines simplicity? Early Jamstack, as Matt Biilmann points out in his talk, definitely embodied it. By solving the build and deployment complexity, creating early Jamstack sites became simple, but, by and large, the nature of the sites we built weren't complex.

Can we build more complex sites without making them increasingly complicated to develop? That's part of the promise of tools like Remix, Astro and a range of newer frameworks and it seems to be driving adoption. Will they retain that sense of simplicity as they evolve to meet the needs of new users? We'll see.

## What's Good

[Keep It Simple, Frameworks: Netlify CEO Praises Astro, Remix](https://thenewstack.io/keep-it-simple-frameworks-netlify-ceo-praises-astro-remix/)<br>
This is a good review of Matt Biilmann's keynote at [TheJam.dev](https://thejam.dev), which laid out his view of how Jamstack evolved, gaining a lot of complexity, since his initial introduction of the concept and how he sees the future of it. If you'd like to watch Matt's keynote, it's [posted to YouTube](https://youtu.be/j3uvh9994tc?si=Dh3S7W11U2OkyLlQ). It's also worth checking out this [alternative point of view from Bryan Robinson](https://youtu.be/VfJ5vEiBi5Q?si=oova7Vvulm-9NH__).<br>

[Removing React is just weakness leaving your codebase](https://begin.com/blog/posts/2024-01-26-removing-react-is-just-weakness-leaving-your-codebase)<br>
There have been quite a few posts bemoaning the current state of React lately (as Simon points out). Simon's post is a good overview of some of the concerns about React and why you might consider an alternative.<br>

## Tools, Resources & More

[Nuemark](https://nuejs.org/blog/introducing-nuemark/) is a Markdown-based text editing format for rich internet content (think MDX-like components expressed as Markdown). The standalone library works with Bun, Node, and Deno.

Zach Leatherman, Eleventy's creator, recently announced an upcoming virtual conference called [11ty International Symposium on Making Web Sites Real Good](https://conf.11ty.dev/) in May. Details are forthcoming but I love the name already!

[Astro 4.3](https://astro.build/blog/astro-430/) adds experimental support for specifying different domains/subdomains for different supported locales along with other improvements.

[Deno v.1.40](https://deno.com/blog/v1.40) adds the Temporal API for advanced date and time operations, as well as the latest decorator syntax.

[Nuxt 3.1](https://nuxt.com/blog/v3-10) adds experimental shared asyncData when prerendering, meaning `useAsyncData` and `useFetch` calls will be deduplicated and cached between renders.

Lene Saile has released a 2.0 version of her Eleventy starter called [Eleventy Excellent](https://eleventy-excellent.netlify.app/blog/eleventy-excellent-20/).

[Sensitive environment variables](https://vercel.com/changelog/sensitive-environment-variables-are-now-available) are encrypted secrets (environment variables) that  can only be decrypted during builds. They are replacing Vercel's legacy secrets.
