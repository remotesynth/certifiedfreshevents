title: "Is Web Development Getting Too Complex?"
issue: 99
date: 2024-02-22T10:23:09.293Z
description: "Your Jamstack update"
---

The last issue was all about hoping for a return to simplicity, and this week leads with a similar argument. It feels as though many developers are taking stock of where we stand in the current state of web development and lamenting how we allowed things to get so complicated.

The important question is, does this added complexity of creating the site result in a better experience for the site's users? If yes, then the complexity, while lamentable, is necessary. If not, it's probably worth asking if you are using the right tools for that particular job.

## What's Good

[Web Development Is Getting Too Complex, And It May Be Our Fault](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/02/web-development-getting-too-complex/)<br>
This is a lengthy manifesto for using the right tool for the job by reducing our dependency on JavaScript frameworks, fighting against vendor lock in and, ultimately, making choices that lower the complexity of your codebase.<br>

[Astro Creator: New Web Metric Will Hurt JS Framework Sites](https://thenewstack.io/astro-creator-new-web-metric-will-hurt-js-framework-sites/)<br>
Next month, Google will introduce Interaction to Next Paint (INP) to web core vitals. Fred Schott, creator of Astro, tweeted some charts illustrating how that might impact sites built with frameworks like Next.js and Nuxt, though these frameworks have newer features that help mitigate the impact. [This post](https://blog.logrocket.com/exploring-interaction-next-paint-new-core-web-vital) discusses what INP is in detail.<br>
