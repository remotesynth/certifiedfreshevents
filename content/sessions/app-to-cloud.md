Have you heard? Very soon Azure's service Static Web Apps will move from Preview to GA. Itâ€™s a full experience of hosting your web app, with serverless functions, authentication, global distribution, and more. Configure and deploy from GitHub within minutes. Shmuela will show you how to use SWA and connect it to Cosmos DB, demoing on her full-featured app.
