Personalization is key to optimize site engagement and give the most relevant experience for your visitors. Join this session to learn how to connect blazing-fast personalization from Uniform.dev with Next,js, Gatsby, Nuxt or Gridsome, working with your CMS and CDN of choice.

Weâ€™ll explore different types of personalization and guidelines on what to use where and more importantly, we step through, hands-on, how you can get up and running with adding personalization to your existing Jamstack site by taking a vanilla Jamstack site and go through code examples on how to connect decoupled personalization.
