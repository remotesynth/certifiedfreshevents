Personalization is key to optimize site engagement and give the most relevant experience for your visitors. Join this session to learn how to connect blazing-fast personalization from Uniform.dev with Next,js, Gatsby, Nuxt or Gridsome, working with your CMS and CDN of choice.

We’ll explore different types of personalization and guidelines on what to use where and more importantly, we step through, hands-on, how you can get up and running with adding personalization to your existing Jamstack site by taking a vanilla Jamstack site and go through code examples on how to connect decoupled personalization.
