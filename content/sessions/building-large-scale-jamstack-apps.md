The talk describes how Jamstack benefits web projects in large organizations. Starting with a general description of advantages of the approach over monolithic architectures in those use cases. Both technical and non-technical points are brought up. A focus is also put on how to talk about Jamstack with non-technical stakeholders. Further the talk will touch on best solutions and tools for Jamstack-based web projects in large organizations.  An emphasis is put on describing the importance of understanding stakeholders needs and choosing a stack that allows the development team to quickly deliver new features and easily maintain existing ones.
