title: Choose Your Own Adventure with Astro
---


Have you found yourself working with one JavaScript framework but curious of what others have to offer? Often branching out can result in multiple projects and redundant efforts. In this session we’ll explore Astro, an all-in-one framework for content-focused websites.

We will explore how Astro’s Islands Architecture can support multiple JavaScript libraries at once including React, Vue, Preact, Svelte, and Solid. We’ll also examine the rendering lifecycles Astro has to offer such as server-side and Partial Hydration.

Having an approachable, flexible approach, Astro allows for both creative integration and continual learning.
