title: Create CMS-editable pages with no client-side JS or frameworks
---


In modern development, there are so many great tools for developing websites, but often they are more than what’s necessary for a given project. In this lightning talk, we’ll explore how to take a humble HTML page and make its content editable in a CMS with no frameworks and no client-side JavaScript.

Our final product will be a website that only contains HTML. That’s right, no CSS, no JS. Just pure markup! We’ll explore how to create a build process to fetch data from a third-party API, run it through a templating engine, and finish with a lovely set of semantic HTML that any browser could love.
