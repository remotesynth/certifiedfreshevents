Inclusive content writing is more than providing atl descriptions for images and transcripts for videos. It's authoring material that is considerate, respectful, and accessible to a diverse audience, regardless of their background, identity, abilities, and learning styles. Inclusive content writing ensures everyone can engage with and understand the presented content. Attendees will gain a better understanding of how people with various neurological disabilities perceive content and how to apply the applicable WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria. This talk also covers a few best practices for authoring inclusive content to improve the user's experience. We will also dive into modern technology, such as AI, to assist with the writing process.
