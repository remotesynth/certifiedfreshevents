---


Inclusive content writing is more than providing atl descriptions for images and transcripts for videos. It's authoring material that is considerate, respectful, and accessible to a diverse audience, regardless of their background, identity, abilities, and learning styles. Inclusive content writing ensures everyone can engage with and understand the presented content.
