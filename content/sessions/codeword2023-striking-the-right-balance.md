In many cases, the business side and the engineering side of content seem to be working at odds with each other. Developers want tools for content that are flexible and easy to integrate with their preferred tools while the business users want the ease of editing, previewing and publishing, without needing developer intervention.

Over the course of his career, Chris Coyier has been on both sides of the issue, having built a business focused on publishing content while also being a developer working on the code. In this discussion, we'll chat about some of the challenges in choosing the right tools for handling content, how to balance the needs of the business users and the needs of developers, and hear about his experiences with full-stack solutions like Wordpress to fully composable "Jamstack" solutions.
