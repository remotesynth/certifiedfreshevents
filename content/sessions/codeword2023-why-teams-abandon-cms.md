The CMS space doesn't seem to slow down, from FTP-ing HTML files in the 90s to monolithic builds to today’s composable stacks. Along the way, companies and organizations have had to evolve with the times, but it isn’t always technology that forces change. Company culture, user behavior, technical debt, and dozens of other factors can push a team to start fresh. This talk examines why editors end up hating their websites and resort to risky re-platforms to solve their problems. With these key insights, you can help steer your next CMS re-platform toward success.
