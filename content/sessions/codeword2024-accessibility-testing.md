title: Accessibility Testing with Chrome DevTools
---


Did you know you can use the Chrome DevTools to test whether your website is build in an accessible way? If not, let's explore together. In this session, we will explore how we can best use DevTools to our advantage in accessibility testing, discuss what to test for and why and how to incorporate both automated and manual testing in your development cycles.

Chrome DevTools offer a variety of options for accessibility testing, including simulations for visual impairments, checking for accessibility labels, color contrast and insights into the accessibility tree. We will discuss these techniques, as well as common sources of accessibility issues and how to approach them. We will also explore how to convince your team or manager to invest in accessibility testing and where to focus your attention if you have limited time & resources.

Let's make the web more accessible, one page at a time!
