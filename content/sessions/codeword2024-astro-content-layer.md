We all know that great content is key, and Astro is one of the best frameworks for building fast, SEO-optimized, content-first websites. But what if you could take it a step further?

In this talk, I’ll show you how to harness Astro's Content Layer to create a custom loader that can pull data from virtually any source. I’ll be using Strapi, a powerful headless CMS that makes it easy for content managers and editors to handle and update their content effortlessly.
