Chances are good that everyone here has talked about “content as code”…and I get it. But the problem is that’s only half the story. Content has an important duality, one that makes it incredibly powerful as well as challenging to work with effectively. Just as light is both a particle and a wave, content is both “code” and…meaning.

If you concentrate only on one or the other, you miss the important stuff. Like the challenges of moving from ideas to structured content. Or the differences between working with content and creating content. And the importance of an environment in which everyone who has a hand in content can operate independently while still working in coordination.
