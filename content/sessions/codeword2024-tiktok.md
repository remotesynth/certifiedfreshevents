title: How we grew our YouTube channel to 500K subscribers with...TikTok?
---


Short-form video platforms like TikTok are an unexpected gift to Developer Relations. In this talk, we’ll explore how leveraging TikTok videos and cross-posting them as YouTube Shorts helped us grow our YouTube channel to over 500K subscribers. We’ll dive into the mechanics of content repurposing, the algorithms that reward engagement, and how short-form videos offer a direct line to the developer community.
