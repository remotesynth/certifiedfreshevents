Most developers don't think of themselves as writers, but keeping a dev blog can be a huge career boost. It's not because your blog will make you a thought leader/internet-famous content creator. It's not necessarily even because your blog will attract recruiters looking to hire you. It's because writing helps you think. It helps you remember what you did. And it helps you show your work if you _are_ on the market.

Attendees of this short talk will learn:

-How to get ideas for what to write about
-How to turn those ideas into posts
-What platforms to use to get started today
