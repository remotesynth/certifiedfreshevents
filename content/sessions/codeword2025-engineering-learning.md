Content powers the web, but from a developer’s perspective, it’s often treated as an afterthought. At Postman, we think about content differently, as a system to be engineered, scaled, and delivered with the same rigor we would typically apply to software.

On the Customer Education team, we build technical workshops that are more than slides. They’re hands-on learning environments where users tackle real API challenges. Under the hood, it’s all powered by code: AWS infrastructure, a learning management system, and custom tools we’ve engineered to make the API landscape accessible.

This talk explores how professionals in tech can approach content as a first-class product: balancing clarity and accessibility with interactivity, bridging customer and community needs, and ensuring content is designed not just to be consumed, but to be experienced.
