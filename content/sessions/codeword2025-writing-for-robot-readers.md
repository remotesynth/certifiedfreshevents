Let's be honest – a good chunk of your audience right now may not necessarily be human. In many cases, your content is being consumed, repurposed and reproduced by LLMs. Consumers are largely forgoing link clicks and getting their information from AI summaries or ChatGPT directly. How do you ensure that your content is written and presented on the web in a way that enables this type of consumption and helps ensure the AI produces accurate results about your product or, in some cases, how do we prevent certain content from being consumed at all? Join us for a chat with Rizèl to cover these topics and more, including your questions.
