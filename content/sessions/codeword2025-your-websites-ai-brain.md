 Your website's content is sitting there, doing its job, but what if it could actually talk back to your users? What if instead of making people hunt through pages and search results, your content could have intelligent conversations and provide expert answers?

I'll show you how to build custom AI agents that turn your headless CMS into a smart knowledge base using an AI Toolkit and Algolia search. We'll walk through the entire process of creating agents that can understand and respond to user questions using your existing content.

**You'll learn**:

* How to set up your CMS content so AI can work with it effectively
* Building search indexes with tools like Algolia that power intelligent responses
* Using an AI Toolkit to create conversational agents with retrieval-augmented generation
* Connecting real-time search results into AI conversations
* Keeping your AI responses accurate and on-brand
* Real examples from production implementations

By the end, you'll know exactly how to build AI agents that turn your content into conversational experiences - whether that's customer support, product recommendations, or expert consultation tools.

**Who should attend**: Developers building front-end websites or apps working with headless CMS and anyone wanting to make their content more interactive and intelligent.
