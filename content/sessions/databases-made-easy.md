### Combining the guarantees of relational databases with modern web and the power of NoSQL

The last 20 years have burned the CAP theorem and a false binary choice between NoSQL or relational databases into developersâ€™ brains. We have always heard that databases have to make a choice; either they focus on correct relational data or they focus on distribution, scale, and speed. Developer experience and the consequent user experience has been an afterthought. Today, new algorithms enable databases that provide consistency, relations, scale, distribution, and speed without sacrificing the developer experience. In this talk, we debunk a number of myths and show how Fauna combines the guarantees of relational databases with the power of NoSQL.
