Our world has been turned upside down. We’ve seen a global pandemic, racial divide, wildfires, and a heated Presidential Election. Not to mention Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quitting the royal family. What are we to do? It’s hard to deal with normal work burnout and stress let alone the compounding effect of all the crazy world events going on. In this talk, we’ll take a look at caring for yourself and loved ones, setting boundaries, and developing a routine. We’ll also explore various techniques and tactics to stay mentaly and emotionally healthy. If we are more cognizant of our mental and emotional health and of those around us, we are then able to reverse and even prevent burnout and stress in our lives.
