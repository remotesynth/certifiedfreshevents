Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, “We need a website, an iOS, _and_ an android app! But… we don’t have that many developers…” It’s tough knowing three languages and ecosystems just to get your app in front of all your users. What if there was a better way? Progressive Web Apps could be the solution to your app woes. PWAs are cross-platform, searchable, opt-in apps that can provide native-like experiences using web technology (JS, React, Vue, etc). This talk is going to not only explain what a PWA is, but when you should make one and how to do so easily with your existing skills!
