You've likely heard the term "Developer Relations" being used in the last year or two and there's a high chance that someone you follow on Twitter just announced that they joined Microsoft or Google's "Cloud Developer Advocate team" but what does this actually mean, and more importantly, why should you care? After all, you just want to commit your code and keep the API up and running. Mary Thengvall, Author of The Business Value of Developer Relations and an experienced Technical Community Manager will explain the difference between Advocates, Evangelists, and Avocados, as well as help you understand how to interact with this new group of folks in a way that is beneficial to everyone.
