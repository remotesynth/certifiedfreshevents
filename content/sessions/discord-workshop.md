In recent years, Discord has sort of exploded as a community platform. It has since been adopted as a core platform across technical and non-technical communities. What once primarily was used in the gaming industry has now been more widely adopted across communities of all types.

Let’s explore a little bit of the platform's history, how it’s being used today, and why (or why not) it makes a fit for your community's needs. We’ll also go over tips and tricks to using the platform, basic bots and platform features, and the possibilities of what you could do with this in the future.
