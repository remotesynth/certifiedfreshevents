Many of us are working on enterprise applications but I often find myself frustrated and lost with how to architect an application in the beginning. There are many things we have to worry about when building large applications especially with large volumes of data and configurations. How do we know what to focus on and where to start while keeping best practices and optimum performance in mind? In this talk, I will go over the journey we went through to create an enterprise application from the ground up for the IBM Cloud. This will include the following: React Containers & Components Redux Actions Redux Reducers GraphQL Middleware and server side routing Testing By the end of this talk, you will be able to understand how to utilize React, Redux, GraphQL, and other tools for your enterprise application!
