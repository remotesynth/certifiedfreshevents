title: Balancing Flexibility and Productivity in Your CMS
---


Content-driven architecture is a balancing act when working to optimize speed and flexibility in content editing. Often the spectrum is skewed. To strike this balance, we can create a system founded on flexibility, with guardrails catered to the unique needs of our content editors.

In this talk, Tiff will touch on common challenges with content-driven architecture, and how to create a system that balances both flexibility and productivity. If you or your content team hates your CMS, this is the talk for you, as youâ€™ll leave inspired to breathe new life into your content authoring experience.
