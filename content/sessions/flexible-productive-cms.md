Content-driven architecture is a balancing act when working to optimize speed and flexibility in content editing. Often the spectrum is skewed. To strike this balance, we can create a system founded on flexibility, with guardrails catered to the unique needs of our content editors.

In this talk, Tiff will touch on common challenges with content-driven architecture, and how to create a system that balances both flexibility and productivity. If you or your content team hates your CMS, this is the talk for you, as you’ll leave inspired to breathe new life into your content authoring experience.
