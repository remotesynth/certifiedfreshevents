title: Fostering Your Local JavaScript Community
---


In this talk, Carlos Souza will share some of his experience facilitating user groups for the last decade. Over this period, technology has drastically changed and it continues to constantly evolve. JavaScript, more specifically, has gone from a simple tool used to animate websites to being the main engine which powers enterprise-grade systems. This presentation will cover lessons learned from fostering a community of technologically-likeminded people and thoughts on what this community might look like in the future.
