There's never been a better time to tinker with electronics. Once the domain of hard core enthusiasts with a penchant for obsessing over optimizing C code, the world of electronics and the IoT is now flush with boards, kits and devices that are tailor-made for the new maker, and which have all the speed and power that the pros have. If you're a developer, you already know half of what you need in order to start lighting things up and making things go, and there are a number of kits out there that let you use the languages you know to power the IoT. And once you get into the space, you won't help but want to share it with others, from friends to your kids. In this session, Brandon will share tools and tips for getting yourself--and your kids--involved in the world of electronics.
