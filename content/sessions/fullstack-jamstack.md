Jamstack is primarily a set of technologies to drive UIs. It empowers frontend developers to wrangle backend APIs into compelling experiences easily. That leaves many developers wondering where "everything else" goes - things like user registration, authentication, restricted access, user-generated-content, commerce and search.

In this session, I'll take you through a Jamstack architecture that has more than just a frontend. I will help you architect and build solutions that enable you to solve all of your customers' requirements.

* Learn the kinds of solutions that Jamstack is great at solving
* See how you can add existing APIs onto your Jamstack solution
* Learn how you can build new APIs to solve unique customer problems as part of your Jamstack website
