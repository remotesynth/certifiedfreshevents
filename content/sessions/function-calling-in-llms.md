The latest hype train in the industry is "AI" and "large language models". They've been sold as the next coming of sliced bread and proponents of them claim that they're omnipotent beings incapable of fault or something. This is not the case. In my talk, I'll cut through the hype and cover what large language models actually are and how they work so that you can use them to their best potential.

No math background is required to understand this talk.
