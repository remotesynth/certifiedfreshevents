title: Future of WebXR API's and Data Visualization
---


We are gathering more data than ever before. Are we able to analyze and learn from it? Are we able to access the data in the right context? We have a lot of ways to analyze and visualize data on the web today. Now we have the capability to have the visualizations and data we need at the right time and right place. WebXR APIs allow us to create Augmented Reality applications that can integrate the virtual data into our world. Unlike Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality doesn't require us to be immersed in a different world but extend real world. With the new APIs possibilities are endless. Let's take a look at how to get started with the next generation of user experience on the web.

If you are asking yourself "what is the WebXR APIs anyways?", "What happened to WebVR?" and "I am not a game developer, would I ever use the WebXR APIs?" this talk will answer all your questions. Maybe even get you excited about being a web developer today!
