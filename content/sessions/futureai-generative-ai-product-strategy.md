title: Generative AI and Product Strategy (Panel Discussion)
---


We invite an operator-turned-AI-focused VC, a product director at a series D startup, and a founder of an LLM infrastructure startup to discuss key questions like:

* Are LLM capabilities over- or under-rated? What are commonly missed limitations of this new technology?
* What are the common mistakes youâ€™re seeing as companies attempt to incorporate LLMs into their products?
* What are the net new use cases that can addressed by LLMs and which companies are best positioned to solve them?
