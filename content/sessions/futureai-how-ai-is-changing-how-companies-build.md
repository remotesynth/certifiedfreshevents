Join us to learn how AI is already changing the way companies build and scale their organizations. We will discuss ways we can leverage AI to drive systematization, eliminate busywork, foster deep + creative work, and encourage collaborative decision-making across the organization. We’ll focus in particular on the impact of AI for product and engineering teams — changes we are already seeing in how we build and develop product and in the internal product and engineering workflows that power teams. We’ll also discuss concrete ways you can start to harness AI in your day to day.
