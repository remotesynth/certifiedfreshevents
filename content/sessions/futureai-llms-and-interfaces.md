Many have claimed that AI agents will kill graphical user interfaces. In this talk, I’ll argue that this claim is overstated and I’ll sketch a framework for thinking about which types are GUIs are most susceptible to being replaced by AI agents. We’ll see that in most cases, a graphical user interface is still the right choice for addressing user’s needs. In the final part of the talk, I discuss examples of how LLMs will replace specific components of traditional GUIs and broadly shift how we interact with computers.
