title: '#gitPanic - Merging and Rebasing'
---


You can commit and push changes, but what if other developers are working in the repo at the same time as you? How do you add changes from one branch to another? What the heck is interactive rebasing? We'll cover squashing, cherry-picking, resolving conflicts, the difference between merging and rebasing, and more!
