title: 'Love is Blind: Falling in Love with the Command Line and GitHub CLI'
---


In a world filled with sexy user interfaces, understanding and even learning to love the command line can be your most understated tool as a developer. In this talk, I'll share my CLI love story and the reasons why learning to love the command line syntax, basic utilities and file structures has made a better technologist.

At the end of this talk, you'll have a bag full of neat tricks and CLI tools to improve your workflows and a clear understanding of how GitHub CLI can supercharge your CLI experience....and maybe, just maybe, you might even fall in love.
