GitHub Copilot is the most widely adopted AI developer tool in history - and there's a good reason for that: it can do a LOT. It can write code, create complex sql queries from natural language, explain complex (or convoluted) legacy code, suggest variable names, automatically generate commit messages even _read your mind_ and so much more. In this session, we’ll take a look at the most powerful cutting-edge features of GitHub Copilot in your editor. This is GitHub Copilot like you’ve never seen it before.
