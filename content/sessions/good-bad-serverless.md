title: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Serverless Web Apps
---


Outside of micro-services, far away from event triggers and message queues, a growing contingent of web developers are on a mission: to make the web serverless. But I'm a skeptic. I wasn't even sure what "Serverless" actually means or whether or not any of this is even a good idea. But I also know that once the web adopts something, the rest is history. So I did what developers do when they want answers. I built something.

Join me as we dive into an application that Iâ€™ve been building over the past few months to test out this hypothesis: is serverless really a good idea for web applications? Are we moving in the right direction, or just going in circles? These are the hard lessons I learned from the trenches building a Serverless Web Application.
