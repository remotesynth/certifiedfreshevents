In the shadowy corners of developer challenges, teams face haunting pressures to conjure new features and functionality without cursing the core applications. Often dabbling with unfamiliar and eerie tools in the dark realms of deployment. This spooky session will unearth the magic of using AI to automate deployments to Kubernetes in ways that seem bewitching but are actually quite secure. Using the sorcery of Generative AI and GitHub Copilot enchantment, and the spellbinding wonders of GitHub actions, we'll dive into the ghostly details. Mysteries unveiled include: crafting Kubernetes deployment manifests through AI, phantom GitHub actions, AB Testing potions, blue-green incantations, and the haunting corridors of GitHub repo for Dev/Test cauldrons. Prepare for a journey of practical container orchestration for Kubernetes amidst the chilling winds of production. Join us... if you dare! ðŸŽƒðŸ‘»
