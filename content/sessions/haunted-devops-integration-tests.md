Building software is not easy, we are mostly humans writing code... at least until now! I have encountered many spooky elements that must be the work of monsters! Monsters under the bed! In front of the computer! Join me for a session full of surprises and help me celebrate a great Dia de Muertos and Halloween (whatever we can manage)!
