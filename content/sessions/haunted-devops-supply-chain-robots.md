In this session, I'll cover creating automation, shifting left, attack vectors, attestations, verification, zero-trust, and how the SLSA spec helps implement solutions for each.

The main takeaway is that security needs to be applied everywhere in the pipeline. The talk will lead to a greater discussion around the challenges of securing the supply chain, supporting EO 14028 and ISO27001, and improving the security posture of your pipelines.
