In this talk, I will share my experience in building Qovery for the 2 last years - a platform that empowers developers to deploy their applications on AWS, Digital Ocean, and all the other cloud service providers.

**In a few numbers:**

- 12,000 developers use Qovery in more than 150 countries.
- Qovery supports application deployment on 3 cloud providers (AWS, Digital Ocean, and Scaleway).
- We fundraised $5m from outstanding investors (Datadog, Docker, Contentsquare...) in 2 years.
- 15 people work (12 engineers) at Qovery.

**What you will learn:**

- How Qovery works at a high level
- How Qovery works under the hood
- How to build on top of Qovery

**Who should attend:**

- Developers
- SRE
- CTO
