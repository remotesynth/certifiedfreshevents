In this talk, I will share my experience in building Qovery for the 2 last years - a platform that empowers developers to deploy their applications on AWS, Digital Ocean, and all the other cloud service providers.

**In a few numbers:**

- 15 people work (12 engineers) at Qovery.

**What you will learn:**

- How Qovery works at a high level
- How Qovery works under the hood
- How to build on top of Qovery

**Who should attend:**
