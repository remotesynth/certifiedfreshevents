As you may have heard, Deno recently announced their next major version, Deno 2, which features full Node and npm compatibility, as well as delivering the things you previously loved from Deno - built in testing, formatting and linting. We'll do a code-along and build a couple of apps with modern frameworks and tooling. We'll build out a basic API and a cute web app with Next.js and Vite that lists dinosaurs, and then we'll take a look at building a simple chat app with Deno's built in support for WebSockets.
