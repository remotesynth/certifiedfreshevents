title: Introducing Redis, the Database that Developers Love!
---


Often thought of as a cache, there's so much more to Redis. Simon Prickett will show you how to add Redis to your stack to improve performance, synchronize communications between distributed systems and even save you from writing lots of code.

We'll look at concrete use cases written in Python, JavaScript (Node.js) and Java. This introductory session is suitable for coders of all levels.

We will walk through:

* An overview of the Redis data model
* Connecting microservices together with queues
* Counting unique items
* Caching data for performance
* Full text search and secondary indexing
