Conference websites should be fast, nice looking and get your messaging across. Join in as we showcase how to build one for yourself, using Next.JS and Crystallize. There will be theming, custom fonts, fast image and video delivery and dynamic content powered by Crystallize. We'll be focusing on often overlooked bits as accessibility, SEO and responsive ui, all while keeping a keen eye on that pagespeed. Combined this forms a great foundation for a conference website.
