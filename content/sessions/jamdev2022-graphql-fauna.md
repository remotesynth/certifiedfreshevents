Jamstack apps get your code in front of your usersâ€”fast. Fauna does the same for your data!

In this session, you create an account, upload a GraphQL schema, and run your first queries and mutations. It's GraphQL, the easy way! You'll also get a link to a free workshop where you build a complete app using Next.js, GraphQL, and Fauna.
