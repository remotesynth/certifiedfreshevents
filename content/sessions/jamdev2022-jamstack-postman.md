Most developers know the popular devtool, Postman, as an API client. But in this session, we will learn how to use the Postman sandbox, mock servers, and visualizer to architect a complete JAMstack application. By the end of this session, you will be able to build and host a static page without ever putting on pants or leaving the comfort of your own Postman.
