title: "No, Seriously\u2026 What is Jamstack?"
---


I have a confession: I don't think I know exactly what Jamstack means anymore. Oh, sure, I have always had a vague sense of the term and knew that I was a fan. But if you had pressed me on an exact definition a week ago I don't think I could have given you much more than, “the J stands for JavaScript! And… something about CDNs?”

Luckily, I don't think I'm alone. I'm now convinced that NO ONE is on the same page about what Jamstack is. And maybe that's okay. The world has changed a ton since the term “JAMStack” was first coined in 2015, so maybe our definition should change too.

In this talk, I want to explore how we can redefine Jamstack for 2022 as a bigger tent that encompasses a more diverse set of technologies and use-cases, while still doubling down on the benefits of Jamstack that we all love (which, again, none of us seem to be on the same page about). Bring your popcorn for plenty of spicy hot takes!
