Do you have an idea to offer exclusive content, but you also want full control over the platform you use? With the power combo of Eleventy (11ty), Netlify, and Supabase, we'll create an authenticated membership site, no frameworks required. You'll be introduced to the concepts of Eleventy Edge and WebC, and learn how to use them alongside built-in templating languages. This high-level review will get your ideas churning for how to use a truly static site builder for high-performance, dynamic content.
