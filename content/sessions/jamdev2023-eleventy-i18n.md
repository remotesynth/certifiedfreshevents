2023 is the year of the personal website!

Let's take this a step further, and offer our content in all the languages we speak.

Soon, we'll stumble upon the terms "Internationalization" and "Localization". Where is the difference? And what does the accept-language header do? How should we organize the languages in our project anyway? And what do we have to consider in terms of accessibility? 

I figured it out! I'll also explain how we can build a multilingual static site using Netlify and Eleventy 2.0 and its new bundled i18n plugin.
