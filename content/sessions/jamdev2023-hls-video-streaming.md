Viewers have increasingly high standards for video, but the solutions we've relied on aren‚Äôt up to the task. Most of us still serve MP4 videos from our cloud providers.

In this talk, we'll show you how to use imgix's Video API and SDK to deliver buffer-free videos while controlling the full viewing experience.
