title: The Paradigm Shift to Verifiable Computing and Self Sovereign ID
---


I’ll talk about the paradigm shift from cloud APIs to network protocols, and show you how easy it is to jump to web3 with the w3ui libraries and drop-in components. After this talk you’ll be ready to use web3.storage in your React, Solid, Vue, or other front-end apps.
