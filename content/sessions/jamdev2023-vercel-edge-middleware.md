Jamstack applications are known for being extremely fast, but lacking flexibility. That ends now! Do more with Jamstack by pushing logic to the edge with Vercel Edge Middleware. Keep the speed and unlock the power of dynamic.

In this code-included demonstration, you will learn how to use Vercel Edge Middleware to look at key information about your visitors and change the responses you send back, all at the content delivery network (CDN) layer. I'll be demoing with Next.js, but pushing logic to the edge doesnâ€™t stop at Next.js, this feature is available to Gatsby, React, Angular, or any popular frontend framework.
