title: Jamstack 2024!
---


It's now been almost 8 years since Matt Biilmann launched the term Jamstack back in 2016 on stage at Smashing Magazines SF conference. In this presentation Matt will go through the evolution of the Jamstack, catch us up with the current state of modern front-end frameworks and platforms and share his thoughts on where we should all be going from there.
