title: Building a Jamstack Product is an Unfair Advantage
---


Jamstack introduced a clean separation between the backend and the frontend of our applications, and even in the new age of SSR, keeping this separation will afford you an unfair advantage over your competitors.

At Cloudflare, we see both sides of the coin: we build a massive application for our users (developers), and we also see what those developers turn around and build for their users. In this talk, I'll discuss what we've seen work, where we think the industry is going, as well as my own experience in PMing a complex product.

Most importantly, we'll put this into context of Jamstack applications and how, ultimately, having a separate backend is really a lasting superpower which unlocks fast product development, third-party integrations, community excitement, mobile apps, command line interfaces, and anything else that might come up in the future.
