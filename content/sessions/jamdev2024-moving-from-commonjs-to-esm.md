The Eleventy code base is now written using first-party bundler-free EcmaScript Modules. In the last six months we’ve migrated our Node.js project from CommonJS to ESM and we learned quite a few things along the way.

In this talk I’ll share what we learned, why we waited so long to make the jump, why it was an important change moving forward, and our community/ecosystem considerations as Eleventy enters year seven of its existence.
