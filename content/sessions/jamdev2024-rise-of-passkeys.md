In this talk we delve into the pivotal role of advanced authentication methods, specifically passkeys, in safeguarding critical assets, as exemplified by the Galactic Empire's Death Star in the Star Wars saga. The Empire's downfall was not merely due to the Rebel Alliance's bravery but also due to its reliance on archaic security protocols.

The talk explores how passkeys, unlike traditional passwords, offer a unique, unforgeable and user-specific method of access control, making it exceedingly difficult for Rebel spies to infiltrate the Empire's database.
