The Jamstack is dead. No it's not. Yes it is! NO, it's NOT!

Ready to have your mind blown? The Jamstack never truly existed.

On every podcast that had anything to do with the Jamstack, one of the main questions always asked was, "What is the Jamstack?" And despite hundreds of people expressing their thoughts and opinions, we've never really had THE answer…

But now we do! (just in time...)

In this talk, Bryan Robinson — Head of DevRel at Hygraph and host of That's My Jamstack — will conclusively define the Jamstack, taking away all ambiguity that has ever existed with the term and putting an end to the debate on what the Jamstack even is. Once and for all.

Was it the friends we made along the way? Was it the code that was transmitted from the CDN? Was it a new paradigm in coding? Or was it a hype fever dream that we'll never truly wake from? Tune in and find out.
