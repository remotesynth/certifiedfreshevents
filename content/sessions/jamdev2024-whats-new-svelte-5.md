title: 'Svelte 5: What''s New'
---


Svelte is reinventing itself with version 5. The maintainer team has learned from past experiences and feedback, and is taking new directions with changes to the API. This talk provides an overview of the upcoming changes by migrating a little app to using the new APIs. You'll see that Svelte has maintained its ease of use despite the syntactic changes, while becoming more consistent, scalable, and performant than ever.
