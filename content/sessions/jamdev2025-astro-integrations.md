Astro is an all-in-one web framework. It includes everything you need to create a website, built-in. But if you need more, you can easily customize your project using official or third-party integrations.

In this talk, we'll see what Astro is and learn more about integrations: where to find them, how to add and configure them, what they enable, and even how to make one yourself!
