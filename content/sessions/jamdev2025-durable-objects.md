Durable Objects are a JavaScript runtime that make it easier to build stateful backend servers on the edge, similar to serverless functions.

They handle state, compute, and complexity at scale, letting developers concentrate on code.

This punny talk will feature some live-coding to show how Durable Objects work and how developers can use them for a wide range of applications.
