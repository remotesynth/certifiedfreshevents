In my many conversations about JavaScript runtimes with devs around the world I've heard one common sentence - "Oh yes, I've heard of Deno and alternative JS runtimes, I keep meaning to check them out, but I haven't had time!".

Well, I'd like to take this opportunity to introduce you to the Deno runtime and all its built in tools that might make your dev experience more delightful.

We'll start by installing the runtime, and initializing a basic project, we'll look at the built in typescript support, built in linting and formatting, we'll take a tour of the built in test runner and then a brief exploration of Deno's APIs, its support for Web Standard APIs and Node APIs and then we'll look at how simple it is to run your Node and React projects with Deno.

I hope, at the end of this talk, that Deno, and runtimes in general, will feel like less of a black box to frontend devs and that you'll have the confidence to maybe give Deno a try in your next project.
