It started as a pull request to merge a custom WYSIWYG editor. But when asked to add a floating toolbar to a text area, Rizel realized things aren’t always as they seem. Surprisingly, text areas aren’t like other DOM elements. She went down a rabbit hole so you don’t have to, learning about browser APIs like the Popover API, the Selection API, and creative hacks like the mirrored div approach.

Join Rizel for live, interactive demos to learn about these techniques and discover why some of the most common web interactions are more complex than they appear.
