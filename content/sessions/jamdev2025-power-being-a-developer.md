The grift machine will tell you the reason to be a developer is to hit that million-dollar app idea or get a job at a FAANG company. This presentation won't stop you from getting paid. What it will do is help, inspire, and teach you to use your powers for the good of your experience and the experience of those around you. As the web continues to get more user hostile, the tweaks, adjustments, and tools you can create as a developer can create a better experience from a terrible one or conjure a new experience from nothing.
