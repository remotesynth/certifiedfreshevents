Sometimes you just want to get some dynamic content into some static HTML files. If you have a static, hardcoded website that's already built, you don't need to completely rebuild it in order to get dynamic content into it from an API such as a headless CMS. Eleventy is a great tool to do this work - even if you only need to work on one file at a time.

What youâ€™ll need to get flying with Eleventy:

* A terminal window
* Visual Studio Code (or your favorite code editor)
* A sense of humor
* A big hot air balloon (optional)
