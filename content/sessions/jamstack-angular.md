title: Jamstack + Angular === Jamgular
---


Yes, this is only true `if (Jamstack === ‘Jam’ && Angular === “gular”)` but I’m trying to make Jamgular happen. And you can too, with this talk where we create an Angular Jamstack site from `ng new` scratch. We’ll use the one and only Angular static site generator, Scully, as well as discuss other options like using Angular Universal to pre-render the site. We’ll add more functionality to the site using the Scully library and other tools throughout the Jamstack ecosystem. In the process, we’ll also deploy the site to Netlify and take advantage of the git integration to take advantage of the CI/CD workflow. I’m looking forward to coding and jam-ing with you!
