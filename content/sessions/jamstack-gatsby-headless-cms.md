Gatsby was designed from the ground up to improve the user experience across the web. That means performance, SEO, and accessibility are top of mind. They have implemented many out-of-the-box techniques to give you a leg up on providing the best experience for your users.

* Gatsby boasts excellent documentation and a number of starters to help you get a site up and running quickly.
* Gatsby uses GraphQL to build its data layer. That means that Gatsby can collect your data from wherever it may be: Markdown, JSON, your favorite CMS, and third party APIs.
* Gatsby is more than a boilerplate site generator. It's built with performance and speed in mind, which is something you can feel in the final product.

What youâ€™ll need to blast off into Jamstack with Gatsby:

* A terminal window
* Visual Studio Code (or your favorite code editor)
* A giant rocket-ship (optional)
