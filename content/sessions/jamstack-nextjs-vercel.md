---


The world’s leading companies use and love Next.js Next.js helps developers save time by removing the need to use bundlers like webpack and then transform the code using compilers. This enables them to pre-render static pages, adding to a website's performance and its SEO.Next.js also enables hot-module replacement, which means that instead of reloading an entire application when code is changed, it only recreates modules that have been altered.

What you’ll need to get cozy and comfortable with Next.js and Vercel:

* A terminal window
* Visual Studio Code (or your favorite code editor)
* A sense of humor
* A cute puppy or kitten (optional)
