Can an AI generate believable poetry? Join me as we romp through venerable 19th century poetry to create the eMiLy app: a new way to experience the ethereal poetry of Emily Dickinson, rooted in the 1800s but renewed for 2019. In this talk, I'll guide you through the creation of the eMiLy app, a mobile app designed to influence the user's mood. Feeling sad? Take a selfie, and allow Azure cognitive services to choose a happy or sad poem to alter your mood. Or simply select a happy or sad poem, as determined by an AI's natural language processing power, to allow yourself to feel better, or more grounded, by the power of Dickinson's words. Or, discover how an AI can simulate Emily's poetry, generating new poems before your eyes. It's up to you to decide whether machine learning can enhance, or somehow tarnish, the great classics of the 19th century by the Belle of Amherst.
