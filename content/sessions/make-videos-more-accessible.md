title: Make Videos More Accessible with Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS)
---


Have you ever been on a slow internet connection and tried to load a video or stream and itâ€™s frozen?

Adaptive Bitrate Streaming is a video delivery technique that adjusts the quality of a video stream in real time according to detected bandwidth and CPU capacity.

As a developer, you have to make it a priority to make videos more accessible for the viewer to be able to start videos more quickly, with fewer buffer interruptions, and provide them the best possible quality for their current device and network connection, to maximize their user experience and minimize viewer drop-off rate.

In this presentation, I will show you different APIs you can use to make it easy to implement ABS as well as show you a code sample on codesandbox of adaptive bitrate streaming in action.
