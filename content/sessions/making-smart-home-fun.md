With cheaper and more configurable IOT platforms now available, many of us have made our homes more efficient and more intelligent.  Now it’s time to make them more fun.  In this session we’ll explore easy ways that you can introduce new and exciting experiences into your home using your existing setup.  We’ll show that with a few cheap parts,  some code and an Arduino or two, the magic of your Disney World vacation can be recreated in your living room.  Examples will include immersive interactive fiction, enhanced board game night and ultimate laser tag.  So bring your imaginations and prepare to have some fun.
