Do you have high uptime requirements for your serverless applications? Are your users geographically distributed, either within a geographic region or across the globe? Active-active failover architectures address these challenges and are cheaper in serverless architectures than in traditional applications.

In this talk, you learn a reusable pattern for implementing an application that runs in multiple regions on the same cloud service provider. Performance is compared to traditional architectures, and solutions to the major challenges of data, deployment, and DNS are provided. Finally, special considerations for security, compliance, and observability are addressed.

This advanced-level talk is for developers already familiar with serverless architectures who need greater uptime without sacrificing performance. Attendees should expect to leave with the knowledge and confidence to build and deploy active-active multi-region architectures in their own serverless applications. Although specific tools are used to present a working solution, the concepts can be applied across vendors.
