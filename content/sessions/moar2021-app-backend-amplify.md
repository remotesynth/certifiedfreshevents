title: Create an Application Backend in Clicks with the Amplify Admin UI
---


There's a lot that goes into building a modern application: the frontend for users, data persistence, user authentication and authorization, business logic, cloud deployment, and much more. The AWS Amplify Admin UI allows users to create and deploy an offline-ready application backend in clicks and then extend it with code, lowering the complexity of fullstack development for frontend and mobile developers. We'll build a fullstack application backed by multiple AWS services including Cognito, Appsync, and S3 in minutes.

## Roadmap

- Introduction to Amplify
- The state of fullstack development
- The benefits of low code solutions
- Create a schema with the Admin UI
- Use it in your app
- Deploy to AWS
- Add authentication
- Extend with other Amplify services
