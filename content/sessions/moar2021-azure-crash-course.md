title: An Azure Functions Crash Course
---


Are you familiar with serverless and FaaS offerings? Perhaps you’ve given things like AWS Lambda or GCP Cloud Functions a try. I’d like to introduce you to Azure Functions, a serverless compute service in Azure. In this talk, we’ll cover some use cases, what we need to develop Azure Functions locally, the most popular input and output bindings and how we can mix and match them to fit our needs, deployment to production, integration with other Azure services and more.
