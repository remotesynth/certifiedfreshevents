Serverless is scalable and boundaryless – so should be health care. So, can this flexible architecture give us the boost to tackle future pandemics and cure genetic diseases? COVID-19 has highlighted the need to substantially improve our disease preparedness and the use of modern cloud architecture will play a key role. This session talks about how CSIRO has leveraged serverless to advance three areas of the COVID-19 response. From taking the “fingerprints” of different virus strains to guide vaccine developments (INSIDER), to tailoring diagnostic efforts (SAUTE) by searing thousands of related virus genomes in parallel, and ultimately creating a serverless surveillance system for COVID-19 (SpreadStopper).

The talk concludes by looking to the future where genetic diseases can be cured using the serverless search engine for the genome (GT-Scan), which automatically works out the best way to edit
a “misspelled” gene.
