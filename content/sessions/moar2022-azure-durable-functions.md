In this session you will learn the fundamental concepts you need to know in getting started and developing serverless functions with Azure Durable Functions, the extension of Azure Functions that enables developers and cloud engineers create stateful workflows in serverless environments while improving developer productivity by focusing on delivering functionality without worrying about maintaining the cloud infrastructure.

Get a technical glimpse of the different known durable functions application patterns that can help solve some complex problems in real world scenarios. In this session, you will see a few examples of the different patterns like function chaining with integration with other Azure service like Azure Storage, Azure Service Bus, SendGrid and external APIs using C# .NET
