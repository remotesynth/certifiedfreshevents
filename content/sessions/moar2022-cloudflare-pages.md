title: Building Serverless Applications with Cloudflare Pages
---


With the advent of serverless, we don't have to worry about managing our own servers. Thanks to the introduction of serverless applications, you can now write a function and deploy it to the cloud.
In this talk, we'll build a serverless application using Cloudflare's stack. Weâ€™ll use Pages to host our static content, Functions for managing the dynamic part of our app, Workers KV to persist data, and Wrangler to do local development together with Cloudflare Pages offerings like unlimited preview environments, fast builds, and integration with a Git client.
