In the world of cloud development, security is paramount. But generating IAM policies that grant the right level of access can be a challenge. Join Nancy as she unveils the power of LocalStack’s IAM Policy Stream. This feature acts like a guardian, dynamically generating least privilege IAM policies based on your application’s AWS API calls in real-time. Discover how the Policy Stream helps you:

* **Simplify IAM policy creation**: Eliminate manual configuration and ensure your policies align precisely with your application’s needs.
* **Embrace the principle of least privilege**: The Stream identifies the minimum permissions required, reducing attack surfaces and enhancing cloud security.
***Streamline local development workflows**: Gain valuable insights into your application’s IAM interactions, leading to faster development cycles.

This talk is an essential resource for developers who want to build secure and efficient cloud applications locally with LocalStack. Nancy will delve into the technical aspects of the Policy Stream, showcase practical use cases, and provide tips for leveraging it effectively in your development process.
