Controlling what your users see, and achieving good performance when it comes to page speed and response times, all influence how effective your web sites are. Getting it right can be hugely profitable. Getting it wrong can be costly for us all.

There have never been more technologies and approaches available to us as developers and technical architects. Trends and popularity and “best practices” seem to change all the time, so how do we choose the right approach for our projects?

In this talk, we’ll explore a number of popular techniques for populating and delivering content into web views for our users. We’ll compare different rendering models to help us understand the benefits and limitations of each one, and we’ll build examples with different tools to show how our choices influence the developer experience, user experience, and environmental impact of our projects.

Key takeaways:
- Understanding and applying the robustness principle to our architectures
- How to mix and match rendering model like SSG +SSR + ESR + CSR
- Minimising “work done” in servers and in client devices as environmental and performance benefits
- Making things with tools we understand can be more resilient and more fun than working with the latest #magic
