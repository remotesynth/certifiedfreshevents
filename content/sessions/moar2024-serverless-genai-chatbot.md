title: Building a Domain Specific, GenAI Chatbot with Serverless
---


Navigating the complexities of Generative AI (GenAI) is made simpler with serverless technologies and API-driven approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs). This session will showcase how leveraging [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/) with Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) and [AWS Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) can streamline GenAI application development. Additionally, we'll demonstrate how [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) simplifies interacting with LLMs. By the end, you'll understand how these tools offer a straightforward path to creating effective and targeted GenAI applications.
