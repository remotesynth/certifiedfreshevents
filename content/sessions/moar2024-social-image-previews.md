When you share a link to a site and see a preview image, that’s an OG image. There are different ways of creating these images to optimize reach, share-ability, and engagement. You _can_ create these images statically, e.g. at build time, but we’ll demo how to go beyond statically created previews by creating dynamic OG images that update as frequently as you need them to. Join me to see how fun and easy it is to create OG images for yourself (no server needed)!
