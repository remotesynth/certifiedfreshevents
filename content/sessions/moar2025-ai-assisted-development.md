Let's explore how the future sustainability of the software development craft will require us to double down on creativity and other existing technical skills and how this intersects with AI-assisted coding. One year ago, I wouldn't have even considered using AI to help me write code, but things started to change last year and have rapidly changed ever since. In this (hopefully) pragmatic talk, I'll share my and other developers' experiences using AI-assisted development, how I use it to be more creative while coding, the tooling and skills that will be important going forward, and the downfalls of this AI-assisted development shift. Lastly, we will touch on how the human experience depends on the "agent experience" when using AI-assisted development.
