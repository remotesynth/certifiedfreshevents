You can't go anywhere on the internet right now without ending up in a conversation about MCP (Model Context Protocol). MCPs are the best way to extend your LLMs and give them better context - but what does this actually mean? Have you ever tried to install Sentry, or Drizzle, or Better Auth using Cursor, and watched as it fumbled through old packages and dated instructions? Yeah, us too. We can fix that.

In this Session, go hands on with Cody De Arkland from Sentry and build an MCP that will build your apps alongside you - the way you want. We'll dive into Cloudflare's new MCP tooling, instrumenting our MCP with Sentry, and by the time you leave you'll have your first MCP server up and running. Bring your IDE, because we're building this one together!
