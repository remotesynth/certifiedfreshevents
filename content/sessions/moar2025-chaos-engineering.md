Ever wonder why some teams intentionally break their own systems? Welcome to the world of chaos engineering. In this quick talk, I’ll break down what chaos engineering is in plain English, why it’s not just for Netflix, and how you can start experimenting with failure on purpose to build more resilient apps.

We’ll talk about real-world examples, what tools make it easy to get started locally, and why waiting for things to break in production is a terrible plan. If you’ve ever said, “it worked on my machine,” this talk’s for you.
