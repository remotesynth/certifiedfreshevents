Serverless makes building event-driven systems easier than ever—but each cloud provider approaches it differently. This session will explore how AWS, GCP, and Azure enable scalable, decoupled, event-based architectures using services like EventBridge, Eventarc, and Event Grid. You’ll learn practical design patterns, compare messaging systems like SQS, Pub/Sub, and Service Bus, and walk through real-world use cases that show how to build resilient event pipelines across cloud platforms.
