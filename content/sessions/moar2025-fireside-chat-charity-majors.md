Development and DevOps teams are presented with an ever-growing set of challenges today. Many of these are technical in nature, such as integrating new tools, platforms and practices in a rapidly changing software and technology landscape. Others force developers to make extremely difficult moral and ethical decisions that often involve tradeoffs between business requirements and personal beliefs â€“ how to ethically integrate AI being the most obvious example. Charity Majors, CTO of Honeycomb, has been at the forefront of these topics and will share her candid, straightforward and honest takes on the state of technology today.
