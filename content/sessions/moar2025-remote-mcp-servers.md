MCP has quickly become the standard for connecting AI agents to real-world tools and services. But until recently, MCP was limited to local development. This talk covers the shift from local to remote MCP servers, including the technical challenges of deploying them at scale, like handling authentication, transport, and authorization. I'll talk through the evolution of the MCP standard (changes across transport method and auth), key lessons and best practices Cloudflare has learned from building and deploying remote MCP servers. I can also include a live demo to show how to deploy a remote MCP server and talk through some of the exciting developments that will be coming to MCP.
