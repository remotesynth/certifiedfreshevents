As the number of features and use-cases in our apps increase, the logic gets much more complicated to understand and change. In this session, we'll learn how state machines and statecharts (visual formalisms for logic) can help us understand even the most complex of app logic in a clear and visual way, and how we can integrate them in our apps to make features easier to add and eliminate bugs by making impossible states impossible.
