---


There's a lot about modern networking that we all should un-learn. Showing off your knowledge and targeting the "important" connections is the wrong approach. If you genuinely want to be an effective networker, you have to shift away from looking at these interactions as transactional.

I'll give you tips that will help you work through those issues and ultimately make you more comfortable in new spaces with new people. You'll come away from this presentation with advice you can put to use immediately.
