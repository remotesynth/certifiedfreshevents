title: "Oh No You Didn\u2019t: Conflict Management Panel"
---


In this interactive event, our panel will discuss conflict that they have personally faced and how they handled it (even if not always perfectly or even well). Weâ€™ll invite the audience to chime in via chat with their questions or to share situations that they are facing/have faced. In the end, we hope that everyone will leave with new techniques that we use to resolve our conflicts.
