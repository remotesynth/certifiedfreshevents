In this interactive event, our panel will discuss conflict that they have personally faced and how they handled it (even if not always perfectly or even well). We’ll invite the audience to chime in via chat with their questions or to share situations that they are facing/have faced. In the end, we hope that everyone will leave with new techniques that we use to resolve our conflicts.
