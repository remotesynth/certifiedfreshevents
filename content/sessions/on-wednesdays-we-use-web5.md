In today's web, our data often isn't ours. But what if you could change that narrative?Explore the world of Web5, where you reclaim data sovereignty. This beginner's talk introduces you to the core concepts of DIDs, DWNs, and protocols, all with a "Mean Girls" twist. By the end, we'll craft a digital Burn Book. But unlike Regina George's version, this one's all about privacy. Share your messages, but only with those you truly trust.

Get in. We're making Web5 happen.
