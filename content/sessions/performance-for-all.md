title: 'And Performance For All: Understanding A Lighthouse Score'
---


With web traffic becoming predominantly mobile, performance is a priority in development. With one click, developers can now generate a Lighthouse performance report and score.

- But what if the scores that donâ€™t attain 100?
- Do you understand the granularities of the given grade?
- Can you dive into the details of the report results and understand where to make updates??
  This is a talk about the subtleties of the Lighthouse performance score, understanding the speed metrics and how to parse the remainder of the performance audit to improve page loads and ux.
