Ecommerce depends on highly dynamic solutions personalizing experiences for customers from the price of a product to the total cost of that customer’s shopping cart. How can we leverage React and tools like Next.js to bring that dynamic experience to the static web?

In this talk, we’ll explore the challenges of ecommerce in a static world. We’ll talk about what tools are available to us and how we can take advantage of them to build dynamic web apps with a practical example of a Next.js app.
