Live streaming enables impactful community engagement through unpredictable, dynamic, and interactive experiences. However, building reliable, low-latency streaming infrastructure with global scale poses complex challenges. Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) aims to simplify adding live video to your application by providing a fully-managed service built on the same network and infrastructure that powers Twitch.

In this session, I'll introduce you to Amazon IVS and show you how it can be used to create low latency streaming channels for your users that can deliver video with around 2-5 seconds of latency. I'll also teach you how to create collaborative streaming experiences with Amazon IVS real-time streaming where latency is as low as 250ms. There's no need to be a video expert to unleash the power of live streaming in your application. You won't have to think about transcoding, storage, edge delivery - or any of the many challenges that come with building a low latency global network capable of delivering high quality video around the world. As a developer, you should focus on user experience - not building and maintaining the infrastructure that enables it
