So, you don't use the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs in your day job - does that mean they have nothing important to tell us about the nature of the Web? Think again! Katie Fenn takes us on a tour of the Web Audio and Web MIDI APIs by creatively-coding Daft Punk's 1997 classic, "[Around the World](https://song.link/gb/i/696886431)". The talk will reflect on what the Web is good at, and the enduring value of unlicensed standards.
