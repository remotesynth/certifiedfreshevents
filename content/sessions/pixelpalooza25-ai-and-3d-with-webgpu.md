The web just leveled up — and so can your projects. With WebGPU finally landing in browsers, developers now have blazing-fast access to GPU acceleration for both real-time 3D rendering and AI inferencing right in the client. In this talk, we’ll dive into how WebGPU transforms the landscape for web-based AI and immersive experiences, leaving the limitations of WebGL and slow CPU-bound ML in the dust. Whether you're building AI assistants in WebXR, web-based games, or next-gen data viz tools, this session will show you how to push pixels and predictions on your browser.
