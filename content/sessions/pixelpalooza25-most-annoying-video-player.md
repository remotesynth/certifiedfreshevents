What if your video player made you earn every second of playback? In this talk, I’ll show how I used Three.js, react-three-rapier, and Media Chrome to build a deliberately frustrating video experience inspired by 90s arcade machines. From modeling a coin slot to wiring up physics and invisible sensors, you’ll learn how I turned video into a game – and why chasing the worst UX led to something weirdly fun.
