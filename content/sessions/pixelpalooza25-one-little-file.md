Type is how we hear what we read, or to paraphrase Beatrice Warde, it is the clothes our words wear. But ever since we've had widespread support for @font-face and the launch of Typekit back in 2009, mostly what designers hear from their engineering partners when it comes to fonts is a resounding “No. Ok, maybe you can have one or two. But not if it impacts our Core Web Vitals." Yet by combining smart browser hints, finessing your @font-face rules, and exploring the wonders that are variable fonts—maybe we can have it all.

We'll take a fast-paced tour through the <head> of your page, fiddle with your font loading, and get a quick look at just how expressive and responsive we can be—all while actually improving your CWV.
