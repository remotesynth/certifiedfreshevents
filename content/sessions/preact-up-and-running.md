Yep, you heard it right, not React, but Preact! Let’s take a look at this small, fast, lightweight JavaScript library that gives you great performance in a small package - about 3.5 kb! Touting itself as ‘closer to the metal’, Preact targets modern browsers to deliver a fast, modern web experience. Let’s dive into Preact, learning how it differs from React and how easy it is to build a web presence with this small, but effective, tool.
