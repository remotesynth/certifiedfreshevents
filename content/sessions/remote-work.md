title: When Temporary Remote-work Becomes Permanent
---


Many employees were thrust into working remotely with little to no warning. Everybody was scrambling to figure out how to temporarily set up for employees being remote. This temporary shift seems to be moving towards a more long-term situation.

This remote work is not typical of what remote work looked like in the past. There are new challenges that we need to address and plan for. This talk will answer the following questions:

* Are you experiencing Zoom fatigue?
* How do you balance work and caring for yourself and others?
* How do you interview and on-board new team members remotely?

Weâ€™ll explore the ways to make ourselves and our teams successful in a distributed and remote world.
