Community is so hot right now.

For the past decade, most product companies have been striving to create their own communities to capitalize on the attention of folks surrounding their products. When the pandemic hit — we saw an almost immediate spike in the rise of community efforts. Our screen time increased spending countless hours and company resources on Slack and Discord groups, forums, virtual meetups, and online gatherings.

When built properly, maintained actively, and measured correctly, these efforts are among the best word-of-mouth "marketing" for developers, a group of people with a historical and notorious disdain for traditional tactics. Unfortunately, we all too often see this optimized for the wrong metrics and reasons, leaving developers running for the hills.

In this presentation, we’ll explore the evolving role of community in technology. From humble user groups and IRC to modern communities of practice or product.
