Serverless Framework has recently introduced support for multiple serverless providers. You can now deploy serverless applications to OpenWhisk, Google Cloud Functions and Azure Functions as well as AWS Lambda. This allows you to develop platform-independent serverless applications. James Thomas has been working on the OpenWhisk implementation. In this talk, he will introduce the new feature, show you how to run serverless applications on different providers and explain the challenges in developing platform-agnostic serverless apps.
