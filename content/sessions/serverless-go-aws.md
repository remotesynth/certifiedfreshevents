title: Orchestrating Serverless Go Applications on AWS
---


Soon after you decide to embrace serverless architectures you realize the need to coordinate all of the components of your distributed apps and services. In this talk we’ll stitch together a series of Lambda functions written in the Go programming language (golang) to build a serverless Slack command while demonstrating the deployment, logging, metric collection, and distributed tracing that help you effectively adopt the serverless way. You’ll not only pick up some Go, you’ll also see tools like AWS SAM CLI, API Gateway, and Step Functions in action.
