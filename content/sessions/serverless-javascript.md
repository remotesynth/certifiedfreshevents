Serverless is the new buzzword; which is what we needed - another buzzword. Serverless refers to new technologies that let us, as developers, reframe the way we think about building applications when we don’t have to think about the “server” part. Serverless doesn’t mean “no server”; it just means you don’t have to worry about that piece of your application anymore, and we’ll take a look at why that is a beautiful thing for JavaScript developers.
