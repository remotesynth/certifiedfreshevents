Come see how easy it can be to use Google Firebase to take your app idea from concept to launch as a Serverless PWA. In this session, we will show the steps of building a messaging application then demo various aspects of Firebase including Database, Cloud Functions, Hosting, and Authentication. We'll use Angular & Typescript to launch our PWA but the same techniques will work for React, Vue, or even vanilla JS. The presentation will include working code and live demos.
