title: 'Sextech: The Good, the Bad & the Bias'
---


When it comes to sextech, people often let their imaginations get in the way of the facts. One common reason is that the media likes to focus primarily on VR porn and bang-able robots. In reality, these subjects are just a small sliver on the sextech spectrum. Sextech spans everything from menopause technology and sex-ed apps to teledildonics and erotica audiobooks. You encounter it when you use an app to track your menstrual cycle, talk to an A.I. OBGYN chatbot, or simply just watch pornography. In this talk I'll describe:

* A high-level understanding of the field of sextech
* Why sextech is the most lucrative sector of technology based on growth statistics, use-cases and the human experience and how it can help create a safer culture for sexual development and healing
* The current biases sextech faces and how they detrimentally impact marginalized groups, can lead to sexual abuse and stifle innovation within the industry
* The dark side of sextech, how it impacts everyone, and why you need to pay attention
