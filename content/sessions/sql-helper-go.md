Go has an SQL package as part of its standard library. There are also a few  ORM-like and SQL helper libraries that wrap the standard SQL package. In this talk, Ayan will demonstrate how easy it is to implement something similar yourself and demonstrate the power of Go's type system and richness of Go's standard library.
