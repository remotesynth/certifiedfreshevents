Full text search is one of the last obstacles for fully static websites, often being the driver of heavy bandwidth usage, or the nucleation point for backend services making your site not-so-static. Pagefind is a new open source tool that solves these problems by baking a low-bandwidth client-side search into your static site, deployable on your existing static hosting. Join Liam Bigelow for a discussion on how Pagefind confidently scales with you, and a walkthrough of implementing a no-compromise search experience on a fully static website.
