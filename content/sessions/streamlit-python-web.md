---


Caroline Frasca will provide an introduction to [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source Python library that can be used to create beautiful, performant web apps in just minutes. If you'd like to follow along and build your own Streamlit app live, have your IDE of choice ready and [install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) before the session. Caroline will also share learnings on cultivating a passionate developer community, improving developer experience, and capitalizing on virality.
