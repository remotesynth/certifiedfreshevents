title: Creating an Art-making Twitter Bot with Machine Learning
---


Twitter Bots are a great interface for ingesting data and doing awesome things programmatically. In this workshop, weâ€™ll go through how to use Python and tweepy to parse tweets targeted at our    bot account. Our bot will grab the images from the tweets, and use a neural network to apply a style transfer effect that will automatically respond to the sender.

Participants can expect to leave the workshop with an understanding of how Twitter bots are architected, and boilerplate code which they can use going forward to modify for their own use cases.
