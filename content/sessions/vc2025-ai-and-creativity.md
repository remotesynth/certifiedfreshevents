In the early days of the internet, people freely expressed their ideas, sharing thoughts and leaving their mark on every imaginable topic. Over time, as websites and blogs became more specialized, users shifted from active creators to passive consumers. Now, with the rise of artificial intelligence, we have a chance to reverse this trend. AI tools are making self-expression easier than ever—whether in serious discussions or lighthearted, humorous content like memes—bringing back the creative freedom of the internet’s beginnings.

In this lightning talk, we’ll explore how AI is empowering people to reclaim their voices, contrasting the open, expressive culture of the past with today’s passive consumption. We’ll also see how memes, a modern form of expression, blend humor with serious topics, and how AI-driven creativity can transform our study and work environments. Join me to rediscover the joy of self-expression and imagine a future where AI helps us become active creators once again.
