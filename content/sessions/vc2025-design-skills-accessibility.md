The dream is to have technology accessible for everyone regardless of their situation. Technology brings out the best in people and empowers them with every task they complete. Companies provide accessibility features on their websites and products. But do they truly make things accessible? Accomplishing accessibility requires an understanding of design and user experience. When they are combined, they keep developers focused on the number one priority: the users. As long as they keep this focus, developers can better understand the people who will be using their apps or websites. Design is a skill that can help developers better understand the products they’re creating for real people who have real needs. In this presentation, I’ll identify what web design fundamentals every developer needs to know to better connect with their users and what you can do to better understand what their needs are. Just knowing a little bit of web design will help get us one step closer to fulfilling the dream of an accessible web.
