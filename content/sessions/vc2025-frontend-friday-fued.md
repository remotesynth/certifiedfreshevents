Our panelists will go head-to-head, debating the merits of assorted CSS concepts like Flexbox vs. CSS Grid, various CSS frameworks, color values, stylesheet formatting, and more! Though theyâ€™ll have pre-planned issues to discuss, they will also be accepting topic suggestions and arguments from the audience. Come be a part of the action in this highly interactive CSS panel!
