Get hands-on in this talk where we’ll create a GitHub Copilot Extension from scratch. We’ll use the Copilot Extensions SDK, https://github.com/copilot-extensions/preview-sdk.js, and Hono.js, covering best practices like payload validation and progress notifications and error handling. We’ll also go through how to set up a dev environment for debugging, including port forwarding to expose your extension during development as well as the Node.js debugger. By the end, we’ll have a working Copilot extension.
