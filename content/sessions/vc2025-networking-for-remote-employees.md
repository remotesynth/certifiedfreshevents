As a software engineer who began my full-time professional career at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was in a very strange position. On one hand, I knew I needed to network and connect with colleagues but not having opportunities to do this in person made it incredibly difficult. I will talk about my journey from my first job to present-day and the various avenues I utilized along the way to network with others both inside and outside of work. At work, I utilized company business resource groups and employee communities, Slack/Teams channels outside of my working team, and company sponsored volunteer events. I also figured out different ways of interacting with teammates to make up for the lack of in-person interaction, including introducing myself to new teammates over Slack or email. Outside of work, I found industry and tech meetup groups as well as virtual tech communities to further my network outside of work. Having a strong network is vital for career growth, support, and gaining insights from others.
