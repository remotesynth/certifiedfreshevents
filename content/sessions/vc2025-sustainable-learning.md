In this lightning talk, I deconstruct those easily dismissed personal tasks that many of us overlook, like "leave the house" or "commit a single line of code to an abandoned project". I'll talk about how these small, unglamorous "warm bath" efforts, in contrast to the heroic "cold shower" narrative of success, could be the key to building genuine resilience and self-trust.
