Passwords are like underwear. You should change them regularly, and you shouldn't share them with anyone.

Passwords are a pain. They're hard to remember, they're easy to crack, and they're a major security risk. So why do we still use them?

In this presentation, we'll argue that we don't need passwords anymore. We'll explore a variety of passwordless authentication methods, and we'll show how they can be more secure, more convenient, and more user-friendly than passwords.

We'll also discuss the challenges of implementing passwordless authentication, and we'll offer some tips for getting started.

So come join us for a presentation that will make you say, "We don't need no stinking passwords!
