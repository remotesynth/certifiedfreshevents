The Edge is the new frontier of computing possibilities, offering promises, opportunities, and it’s own set of challenges. In this talk, we’ll break down what it is, why it’s awesome, and how it fits into your application architecture.

We’ll cover things like:
- What are the benefits?
- What are the limitations?
- When it makes sense
- When it doesn’t make sense
- How to get started?
