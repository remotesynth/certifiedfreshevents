title: Why I Was Wrong About TypeScript
---


In 2014, I made a strong argument that TypeScript was destined to be irrelevant and that my company should not use it in any of our projects. I was wrong. In 2017, TypeScript is taking over the JavaScript world, and we now use TypeScript for pretty much everything we build.

In this talk we’ll talk a look at why TypeScript succeeded where other compile-to-JavaScript frameworks like CoffeeScript and Dart have languished. We’ll then look at whether TypeScript is a good fit for your next development project.
