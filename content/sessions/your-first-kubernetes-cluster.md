How do you deploy applications on top of Kubernetes to allow for scaling and resiliency? Join our workshop and learn how.

### 🎓 What will you learn?

* How do I scalably architect my ML-based application?
* What is Red Hat OpenShift and how does it compare to Kubernetes?
* How do I deploy a Red Hat OpenShift/Kubernetes cluster?
* We'll conclude with an interactive lab where you'll be able to deploy your own k8s/RHOS cluster and build your own visualization based on our GitHub repo.

### 👩‍💻 Who should attend?

ML developers, software architects, DevOps professionals and anyone who wants to know more about Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift.
