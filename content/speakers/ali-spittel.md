Ali loves teaching people to code, and is currently doing so as a Senior Developer Advocate at AWS. She has been employed in the tech industry since 2014, holding multiple software engineering positions at startups, and a Distinguished Faculty and Faculty Lead role at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive. She blogs a lot about code and her life as a developer and also has a podcast with two other incredible women: Ladybug Podcast. They talk about the tech industry, our backgrounds, and go in depth on code-topics. When She's not coding you can find her watching her favorite New England sports teams, taking runs with her dog Blair, or rock climbing.
