A fan of webhooks, API specs, markdown, and static site generators, Colin loves to teach and explore new technologies. His career has revolved around building, documenting, and, often, breaking API integrations. He is currently a Senior Developer Advocate at Discord. He has a winding journey of starting and building communities online and IRL, such as coworking spaces, conferences, and local meetups. These include Reno Collective Coworking, /dev/reno, Ignite Reno, Startup Weekend, and Hack4Reno. When he's not in front of a computer, he can be found playing D&D with friends, running, or camping.
