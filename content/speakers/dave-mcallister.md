From the shadowy corners of NGINX, Dave emerges, bearing forbidden technical knowledge from the open-source underworld. He whispers tales of the dark powers of microservices and orchestration, conjuring solutions for the most cursed distributed system challenges, primarily through the arcane arts of open source. Since Linux's first incantations to today's ghostly clouds and phantom containers, Dave has been a guardian of the open systems and a high priest of open-source rituals. He often emerges from the ethereal mist to share sinister secrets about emerging software architectures and rituals, the specter of observability, and the chilling ways open-source magics shape our eerie existence today. Beware, for his insights may change the very fabric of your technological realm!
