My name is Erik Hanchett and I'm a software developer from Reno, NV. I'm the author of Vue.js in Action published by Manning and I work currently as a developer advocate for AWS Amplify. When I'm not teaching people how to code on my YouTube channel, you'll find me with my family on the slopes of Lake Tahoe.
