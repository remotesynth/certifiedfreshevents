Erin Mikail Staples is a very online individual passionate about facilitating better connections online and off. Sheâ€™s forever thinking about how we can communicate, educate and elevate others through collaborative experiences.

Currently, Erin builds community and thinks about the philosophy and tooling of the community and developer advocate world. Much of her day is spent empowering individuals to build, foster, and embrace healthy communities. Outside of her day-job, Erin is a comedian, graduate technical advisor, no-code content creator, triathlete, avid reader, and cat parent.

Most importantly, she believes in the power of being unabashedly "into things" and works to help friends, strangers, colleagues, community builders, students, and whoever else might cross her path find their thing.
