Jay is the lead developer at [Reaktiv Studios](https://reaktivstudios.com/), a WordPress centered development shop focused on custom solutions and complex integrations. He has been a developer for over a decade, and has previously worked at Sesame Workshop and Penguin Random House. His passion for the web stretches back even further to an early age, and his first glimpse had him instantly hooked. In 2017, he created the newsletter and blog [The History of the Web](https://thehistoryoftheweb.com/), which combines his love of the World Wide Web and history into both short and long-form posts, updated regularly.
