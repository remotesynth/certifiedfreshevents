I am a Director of Developer Relations, a 3x founder, and an experienced software engineer driven by a passion for crafting innovative educational experiences with global impact. For 25 years I have worked to merge technology and human-centered design, fostering digital literacy and empowering learners worldwide to grow and thrive.

From leading global teams at AWS to creating viral open-source curricula on GitHub for Microsoft, my work bridges the gap between people and tech, inspiring millions. Whether founding and leading a global nonprofit, launching student community programs to build cloud skills globally, designing gamified challenges to engage learners, or authoring books like Computer Science for Kids and The Illustrated AWS Cloud, my mission is clear: to connect the world through transformative, inclusive learning.
