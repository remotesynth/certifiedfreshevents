Joni Trythall is an excitable brand strategist working with developers and tech entrepreneurs to reach their ideal audiences in the most genuine, impactful way possible. As the founder of [YupGup](https://yupgup.com/) and [Wiggle Work](https://wiggle.work/), Joni has always prioritized bringing people together for authentic connection online, believing that working remotely doesn’t have to be lonely and we all deserve a chance to find our people—we are all stronger when we gather. She’d also like you to know that when feeding crows, they prefer cheesy scrambled eggs with turkey above all else.
