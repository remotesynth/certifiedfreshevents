Mrinalini (Mrina) has been "hacking" away at tech projects since the age of 14! Her first project was programming her TI-84 calculator to be able quickly find the hypotenuse of a right triangle. Since then she has been in constant pursuit of employing CS to enable her curiosity; be it building a text messaging COVID bot or a motion detector for her pup's sleep. She is a UC Berkeley Alumnus and currently works as a Developer Relations Manager at Tiugo Technologies.
