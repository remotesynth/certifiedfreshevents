Obinna Ekwuno is a human before anything else and practices Kindness as a service. He mostly works on the web and loves to teach concepts in JavaScript while advocating for web accessibility. He does this through speaking, live streams, and technical articles. Occasionally he is a poet, and he believes that wider conversations will make a better world.

He is currently trying his best to not hinder the backlog as a Developer Advocate at Cloudflare and hopes this last part made you laugh.
