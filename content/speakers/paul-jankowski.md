 Paul is a Senior Software Engineer on the Developer Experience team at Algolia. With almost a decade of experience working on the web, he enjoys thinking about search and ways that search can make the users’ experience better. When he isn’t hacking on the web, he’s either hanging with his family or trying to catch up on the One Piece anime.
