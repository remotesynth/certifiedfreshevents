Ryan (he/him) is a co-founder of Begin, a platform for building Functional Web Apps on AWS. Ryan is also a maintainer of the OpenJSF Architect framework, and the reluctant creator of aws-lite, a fast, community-driven SDK for AWS. When he's not computering, you may find him  (and his family) climbing on some rocks.
