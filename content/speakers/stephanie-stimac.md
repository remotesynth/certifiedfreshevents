Stephanie is a Program Manager for Developer Experiences on Microsoft Edge who comes from a background in web and user interface design as well as front-end development. She's worked on developer tooling in the browser as well as the open source project, webhint.io and is currently leading the Web We Want initiative, a cross browser and cross-company initiative to identify developer needs and bring those changes to the web platform. When not on the web, she can be found mountain biking in the forests of the Pacific Northwest or the Arizona desert and is usually always plotting her next visit to Scotland.
