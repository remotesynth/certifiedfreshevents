Tammy has spent the past two decades studying how people use the web. Since 2009, she’s focused on the intersection between web performance, user experience, and business metrics. Her book [Time Is Money: The Business Value of Web Performance](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041450.do) (O’Reilly, 2016) is a distillation of much of this research (but there’s always more to be learned).

Tammy is a frequent speaker at events like Shop.org, IRCE, and Smashing Conference. She also co-curates WPOstats.com, an ongoing collection of performance case studies.
