Tara Z. Manicsic is a lifelong student, teacher, and maker. She has spent her career using JavaScript on both back-end and front-end to create applications. A Developer Advocate for Progress, Google Developer Expert, and international technical speaker, she focuses on conveying the codebase she has learned. In her free time she works in her community to educate and learn from other developers. Tara launched the Cincinnati Chapter of Women Who Code and the Cincinnati branch of NodeSchool. Beyond code, Tara still makes things but with solder/clay/wool and hikes any mountain she can get to with her family & trusty sidekick, #toshmagosh.
