I’m a developer who advocates and evangelizes about interactive video streaming at Twitch. I’ve been writing code since 2004 and I'm passionate about technology, code, and helping developers learn new things. As part of my role as a Developer Advocate, I write demos to show other developers how to use certain languages, frameworks, and technologies to solve the problems that they face every day. I have a background in writing and a love for theater, so I’m extra fortunate to have found a role that lets me use those skills and passions as part of my everyday routine. I’m married to my best friend and we live in the North Georgia mountains with our 2 kids, 8 chickens, 2 dogs, and a cat. When I’m not working, I love to cook, hike, travel, play video games and tinker with electronics and microcontrollers.
