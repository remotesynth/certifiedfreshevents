In this live coding session, Nick will explore SolidJS, a highly performant reactive framework, and SolidStart, a full-stack meta-framework for SolidJS. You'll learn how to build reactive user interfaces, handle state management, and connect to backend APIs using SolidStart. By the end, you'll have an understanding of how to create and deploy a full-stack application with SolidJS and SolidStart from scratch.
