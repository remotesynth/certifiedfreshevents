The modern website has become an art of composition. It's a rarity that a website will only pull content from a single source these days.

This has become such a common occurrence that we've seen various tools arrive on scene to address the challenges inherent in composable content. Both Bryan's and Sean's companies (Hygraph and Stackbit) are working on the problem, and in _very_ different ways.

This episode will begin with an introduction to composable (or federated) content, before diving deep into challenges, proposed solutions, and inspiration for taking advantage of this relatively new pattern.
