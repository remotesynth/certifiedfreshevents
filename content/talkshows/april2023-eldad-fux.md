It's no small feat to grow a startup from concept to a successful company. We've heard the classic story many times. This one is a little different.

When a product is **open-sourced**, there's an extra layer of challenge to building a company around it. It's not _only_ about making something great. It's a completely different mindset toward adoption, development, engineering, community, and more.

As the founder of AppWrite, Eldad has a deep understanding of this process, along with some insight into overcoming common challenges. Sean, on the other hand, only has a few failed projects to show for his open-source efforts. This combination is sure to be the perfect recipe for a great episode.
