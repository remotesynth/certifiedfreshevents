The idea of web components first emerged a little more than a decade ago. It seemed revolutionary. They were going to be the future of the web.

And then they kind of … disappeared. Component frameworks like React and Angular took the reins, and traditional web components took to the back seat.

And now? They seem to be making a minor resurgence.

In this episode, Sean will work with Evan to try to fill in some of these gaps. Why didn't web components catch on right away? Why are they back _now?_ Are they here to stay? And how can you get started working with them today?
