Before JavaScript took over the world, do you know what everyone loved? Testing!

We were testing so much that we were writing tests before writing the code to make the tests pass.

In the shift to modern web development and _Everything JavaScript All The Time Always_, talk of testing code has cooled significantly. Why? Should we be writing tests for our code today? Or only in certain scenarios? And what tools can we use to get the job done efficiently?

These are the questions Sean will hope to answer in his time with Mark.
