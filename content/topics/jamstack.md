    question: What are the advantages of using JAMStack for web development?
    answer: |
      Modern Jamstack sites tend to rely on a mix of server-side rendering, using serverless (aka lamba) functions deployed to the cloud or even the edge, and static rendering, wherein the assets are created at build time and deployed to a CDN. Jamstack server-rendering encapsulates the data access necessary for the page to render into distinct functions, making the code easier to maintain and more portable/reusable. Meanwhile, static rendering (aka pre-rendering) delivers purely static assets to the edge that are incredibly fast and secure.

      In addition, developers love Jamstack because of the developer experience and customizability. Rather than shoehorning their code within the confines of a monolithic framework, Jamstack tools are generally un-opinionated to how the front-end is built while offering the tools developers need to make creating these front-ends easier.

    question: What technologies should I learn to work with Jamstack effectively?
    answer: |
      A Jamstack developer must be fluent in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Most Jamstack developers start with a framework. There are two types of frameworks:

      1. **Traditional static site generators (SSG)** – a static site generator like Eleventy or Hugo focuses on making it easy to dynamically build the assets for a site and deploy them to a CDN. This doesn't mean the site's generated by an SSG are static, as they can use a combination of JavaScript on the client-side and APIs on the server to add interactivity and dynamic content. Plus, modern SSGs are incredibly fast, making re-rendering the site, even multiple times per day, efficient.

      2. **JavaScript-framework-based tools** – most Jamstack developers use a tool based upon one of the popular JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue. These include tools like Next.js, Nuxt and Gatsby. These are full stack JavaScript tools wherein both the client-side and the server-side of the application are built using the framework. For example, Next.js sites rely on React for both the client-side interactivity and the server-side rendering. However, recently some new tools have emerged that don't rely exclusively on the major frameworks. These include tools like Astro, SolidState and SvelteKit that either allow you to blend multiple frameworks for components (like Astro) or use new frameworks and techniques to offer a different approach to Jamstack development.

Jamstack began as a way to define an architecture that ran on top of static site generators. Originally, the JAM in JAMStack stood for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. APIs brought in data from a variety of services, markup (and Markdown) was used for content and layout and, finally, client-side JavaScript was added for interactivity on otherwise static assets that could be deployed to a content delivery network (CDN). Since then, the concept has evolved with modern Jamstack frameworks like Astro, Next.js, Nuxt and others offering options for server-side rendering at request time and relying heavily upon JavaScript frameworks for more advanced interactivity.

This evolution has led to a bit of an identity crisis for Jamstack where it has become nearly indistinguishible from general web development. Even Netlify, where the Jamstack term originated, has started to use the term composable web instead of Jamstack. Ultimately, the key principle of Jamstack remains the same and remains valuable, regardless of the name. That principle is a separation of the front-end built with markup and JavaScript from the backend running on APIs and services (thus composable). This concept still distinguishes Jamstack from monolithic web frameworks like WordPress, Drupal and others that blend the backend and frontend, and helps make code from Jamstack sites more flexible and reusable.
