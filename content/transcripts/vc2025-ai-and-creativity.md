**Venelouis T. S. Palhano:** [00:00:00] Hello. Firstly, I would like to thank the virtual coffee community, which importantly, I'm not as active in as I'd like to be. But it's an incredible community with incredible people. They hold weekly meetups to talk about various on topics and come together to participate in events like this conference.

So before starting my presentation, I like to thank this entire wonderful community and I hope it prospers more. And more secondly. I want to mention that I am nervous. This is my first presentation like this. My English isn't 100% perfect because of this. I'll be reading a text as you watching this might notice.

I hope this presentation doesn't become too boring. It'll be only about seven minutes or less long, and I'll be [00:01:00] keeping an eye on the chat because this presentation is prerecorded, so I will do my best to make it as entertaining as possible. That's why I added this love laughing sound effect.

I hope it makes the presentation at least a little less monotonous. I hope to participate in more conferences in the future and not be Bennet. So let's go. I will not introduce myself to the time limit of seven minutes, so if you want to know more about me, just try to find me at, so today I will be discussing the following topic, which has the title of competitive consumption to creative voices, how AI is reviving the internet, the spirit of the early internet.

Wow, that's a quite long title, [00:02:00] isn't it?

Sometimes I don't remember what I say or write, but I think that's normal, especially nowadays with AI helping us in so many ways. Right.

One of the things my friends and I like to do in the early internet days. Internet decided of playing games was to chat with strangers online about various subjects and try to get to know or discover more about a person on the other side of the chat. This was not a simple thing to do if you didn't have a advance knowledge of network for that time, and if you were just a child.

So it was practically a form of semi like photo anonymity.

In the early days of the internet, [00:03:00] it was more common to have websites of completely anonymous people because individuals were their own server and hosted their own sites on their own computers. Unlikely. Today, when practically no one creates a website and leaves their computer, turn it on as a server, right?

So the well-known internet freedom was also directly related to anonymity because ordinary people said and did things online without worrying too much about in indentification. So only over time do a various types of crimes being committed and the sometimes negligence sharing of dangerous information as the internet became, become increasingly, increasingly regulated.

Right. But. Even with increased regulation, creative people have always managed, managed to find new and quite effective ways to communicate the explosion and emergence [00:04:00] of memes believe, I believe, is thanks to the peoples need to seek a humor response of communication. That because the early days of the internet when people weren't so concerned with what they said, being taken so seriously.

So I created my own mem page on Instagram column humor hack, and 99% are just copies from the other creators.

I always try to give due credit, but I believe that the function of memes beyond serving, uh, a form of freedom expression can be used to educate in a fun way or just de stress a bit from life, which sometimes seems quite ate with so many possibilities, right? So to conclude, the seven minute or less, I hope less, I ta.

I believe that the al regenerative AI is bringing more power for creation and creativity, possibilities for anonymity and also concerns. However, the well-known [00:05:00] phrase Uncle Bob in Spiderman is very true. With great power comes great responsibility, or as Jesus Christ thought, to who much is given, much will be required.

Thank you again.
